Barron, Third Texas Cavalry                       250INTRODUCTIONAS my recollections of the war between the States, or the ConfederateWar, in which four of the best years of my life (May, 1861, to May,1865) were given to the service of the Confederate States of America,are to be written at the earnest request of my children, and mainly fortheir gratification, it is, perhaps, proper to preface the recital bygoing back a few years in order to give a little family history.I was born in what is now the suburbs of the town of Gurley in MadisonCounty, Alabama, on the 9th day of November, 1834. My father, SamuelBoulds Barron, was born in South Carolina in 1793. His father, JamesBarron, as I understand, was a native of Ireland. My mother2019s maidenname was Martha Cotten, daughter of James Cotten, who was from GuilfordCounty, North Carolina, and who was in the battle of Guilford CourtHouse, at the age of sixteen. His future wife, Nancy Johnson, wasthen a young girl living in hearing of the battle at the Court House.About the beginning of the past century, 1800, my Grandfather Cotten,with his wife, her brother Abner Johnson, and their relatives, Gideonand William Pillow, and their sister, Mrs. Dew, moved out from NorthCarolina into Tennessee, stopping in Davidson County, near Nashville.Later Abner Johnson and the Pillows settled in Maury County, nearColumbia, and about the year 1808 my grandfather and his family came onto Madison County, Alabama, and settled at what has always been knownas Cave Springs, about fifteen miles east or southeast from Huntsville.In the second war with Great Britain (the War of 1812) my GrandfatherCotten again answered the call to arms, and as a captain he served hiscountry with notable gallantry.It is like an almost forgotten dream, the recollection of my paternalgrandmother and my maternal grandfather, for both of them died when Iwas a small child. My maternal grandmother, however, who lived to theage of eighty-seven years, I remember well. In my earliest recollectionmy father was a school-teacher, teaching at a village then called 201CTheSection,201D afterwards 201CLowsville,201D being now the town of Maysville,twelve miles east of Huntsville. He was well-educated and enjoyed thereputation of being an excellent teacher. He quit teaching, however,and settled on a small farm four miles east of Cave Springs, on what isknown as the 201CCove road,201D running from Huntsville to Bellefonte. Herehe died when I was about seven years of age, leaving my mother withfive children: John Ashworth, a son by her first husband; my brother,William J. Barron, who now lives in Huntsville, Alabama; two sisters,Tabitha and Nancy Jane; and myself. About nine years later our motherdied. In the meantime our half-brother had arrived at man2019s estate andleft home. Soon after our mother2019s death we sold the homestead, andeach one went his or her way, as it were, the sisters living withour near-by relatives until they married. My brother and myself foundemployment in Huntsville and lived there. Our older sister and herhusband came to Texas in about the year 1857, and settled first inNacogdoches County. In the fall of 1859 I came to Texas, to bring mythen widowed sister and her child to my sister already here. And so, asthe old song went, 201CI am away here in Texas.201DThe Lone Star DefendersCHAPTER ITHE OUTBREAK OF THE WAR Journey to Texas2014John Brown2019s Raid2014My Secession Resolution2014Presidential Election2014Lincoln Elected2014Excitement in the South2014Secession Ordinances2014201CThe Lone Star Defenders201D2014Fort Sumter Fired On2014Camp Life2014The Regiment Complete2014Citizens2019 Kindness2014Mustered In2014The Third Texas Cavalry2014Roster.NO, I am not going to write, or attempt to write, a history of thewar, or even a detailed account of any campaign or battle in which Iparticipated, but only mean to set forth the things which I witnessedor experienced myself in the four years of marching, camping, andfighting, as I can now recall them2014only, or mainly, personalreminiscences. Incidentally I will give the names of my comrades ofCompany C, Third Texas Cavalry, and tell, so far as I can remember,what became of the individuals who composed the company. I will notdwell on the causes of the war or anything which has been so oftenand so well told relating thereto, but will merely state that I hadalways been very conservative in my feelings in political matters, andwas so all through the exciting times just preceding the war whileAbolitionism and Secession were so much discussed by our statesmen,orators, newspapers, and periodicals. I had witnessed the Kansastroubles, which might be called a skirmish before the battle, withmuch interest and anxiety, and without losing faith in the abilityand wisdom of our statesmen to settle the existing troubles withoutdisrupting the government. But on my journey to Texas, as we glideddown the Mississippi from Memphis to New Orleans, on board the _LizzieSimmons_, a new and beautiful steamer, afterwards converted into acotton-clad Confederate gunboat, we obtained New Orleans papers froman up-river boat. The papers contained an account of John Brown2019s raidon Harper2019s Ferry. I read this, and became a Secessionist. I saw, orthought I saw, that the storm was coming, that it was inevitable, andit seemed useless to shut my eyes longer to the fact.The year 1860, my first in Texas, was a memorable one in severalrespects, not only to the newcomers but to the oldest inhabitant. Theseverest drouth ever known in eastern Texas prevailed until after themiddle of August. It was the hottest summer ever known in Texas, thetemperature in July running up to 112 degrees in the shade. It wasa Presidential election year, and political excitement was intense.The Democrats were divided, while the Abolitionists had nominatedAbraham Lincoln as their candidate for President, with a good prospectof electing him by a sectional vote. Several towns in Texas beingalmost destroyed by fire during the extreme heat of the summer, animpression became generally prevalent that Northern incendiaries wereprowling through the State burning property and endeavoring to incitethe negroes to insurrection. The excitement, apprehension, unrest,and the vague fear of unseen danger pervading the minds of the peopleof Texas cannot be understood by persons who were not in the Stateat that time. The citizens organized patrol forces and armed menguarded the towns, day and night, for weeks. Every passing strangerwas investigated and his credentials examined. The poor peddler,especially, was in imminent danger of being mobbed at any time on meresuspicion.At the November election Abraham Lincoln was elected President. Thiswas considered by the Secessionists as an overt act on the part ofthe North that would justify secession. I was out in the country whenthe news of the election came, and when, on my return, I rode intoRusk the Lone Star flag was floating over the court-house and AbrahamLincoln, in effigy, was hanging to the limb of a sweet gum tree thatstood near the northwest corner of the court yard. From this timeexcitement ran high. Immediate steps were taken by the extreme SouthernStates to secede from the Union, an act that was consummated as soon aspracticable by the assembling of State conventions and the passage ofordinances of secession. Now, too, volunteer companies began organizingin order to be ready for the conflict which seemed to be inevitable.We soon raised a company in Rusk for the purpose of drilling andplacing ourselves in readiness for the first call for troops fromTexas. We organized by electing General Joseph L. Hogg, father ofEx-Governor J. S. Hogg, as captain. The company was named 201CThe LoneStar Defenders,201D for every company must needs have a name in thosedays. Early in 1861, however, when it appeared necessary to prepare foractual service, the company was reorganized and the gallant Frank M.Taylor made captain, as General Hogg was not expected to enter the armyas captain. Several of the States had already seceded, the militaryposts in the South were being captured by the Confederates and FortSumter, in Charleston Harbor, was fired upon by our General Beauregardon the 12th day of April, 1861. The dogs of war were turned loose. Warnow became a stern reality, a war the magnitude of which no one thenhad any conception. President Lincoln2019s first call for volunteers wasfor ninety-day men, and the Confederate volunteers were mustered in forone year.Having learned that Elkanah Greer, of Marshall, had been commissionedcolonel and ordered to raise a regiment of Texas cavalry, we lost notime in reporting ourselves ready to make one company of the regiment,and soon received instructions to report at Dallas, on a certain day inJune, when a regiment would be formed. So on Monday morning, June 10,in the year of our Lord, 1861, we were to leave, and did leave, Ruskfor Dallas2014and beyond, as the exigencies of the war might determine.The population of the town, men, women, and children, were on thestreets, in tears, to bid us farewell. Even rough, hard-faced men whoseappearance would lead one to believe they hadn2019t shed a tear sincetheir boyhood, boo-hoo2019d and were unable to speak the word 201Cgood-by.201DThis day of leave-taking was the saddest of the war to many of us.After we had mounted our horses we assembled around the front of theold Thompson Hotel, which stood where the Acme Hotel now stands, whenour old friend, General Hogg, standing on the front steps, deliveredus a formal and a very tender farewell address. War was not unknown tohim, for he had been a soldier in the early days of Texas, as well as amember of the Texas Congress in the days of the republic. He was a finespecimen of the best type of Southern manhood2014tall, slender, straightas an Indian, and exceedingly dignified in his manner. As brave as201COld Hickory,201D he often reminded me of the pictures I had seen ofGeneral Jackson, and he certainly had many similar traits of character.We venerated, admired, and loved him, and he was warmly attached tothe company. In his address he gave us much good advice, even to thedetails of mess duties and the treatment of our messmates. Among otherthings, he said, 201CDon2019t ever jeer at or mock any of your comrades whocannot stand the fire of the enemy. Some of you, perhaps, will findyourselves unable to do so. Some men are thus constituted withoutknowing it, until they are tried. So you should be charitable towardssuch unfortunates.201D Later I found these words of our old soldier friendto be true. This ceremony ended, we sadly moved off by twos, over thehill, and up the street leading into the Jacksonville road.As we marched forward sadness was soon succeeded by merriment and goodcheer. Some of the boys composed a little song, which was frequentlysung by I. K. Frazer and others as we went marching on. It began:  201CThe Lone Star Defenders, a gallant little band,  On the tenth of June left their native land.201DBefore leaving home we had spent two weeks in a camp of instruction,and learned something of the duties of camp life and the necessary artof rolling and unrolling our blankets. We camped the first night nearJorial Barnett2019s, between Jacksonville and Larissa. Two of the Barnettboys were going with us, and several from Larissa. When we reachedLarissa next morning we there found a young man, Charley Watts, who wasa bugler, and had been in the Federal Army, he said. He was willing andanxious to go with us, and we wanted him, as he was young and active,but he was afoot, and seemed to own nothing beyond his wearing apparel.So we appealed to the citizens, as a goodly number had gathered intothe little village to see the soldiers pass, and in little more timethan it takes to tell it, we had him rigged with horse, bridle, saddle,and blankets. Charley proved to be a fine bugler, the finest bugler Iever heard in either army, and he was a most gallant young fellow. Wemoved on, bidding farewell to Captain Taylor2019s noble and patriotic oldmother, as we passed her residence.Fearing we might be left out of the regiment, we dispatched CaptainTaylor and one or two others well-mounted men to go ahead and secureand hold our place for us. The ladies of Cherokee County havingpresented us with a beautiful flag, this we unfurled and marchedthrough the towns and villages along the way in great style andmilitary pomp. At Kaufman we received quite an ovation. Arrivingthere about ten o2019clock in the morning, we were met by a deputationof citizens, who invited us to dine at the hotel at the expense ofthe town. This was very reluctantly declined, for we were afraid oflosing time. Poor fellows, we often regretted missing that good dinner,and we really had plenty of time, if we had only known it. To showour appreciation of their hospitality we marched around the publicsquare, displaying the flag and sounding the bugle. When we had arrivedin front of a saloon we were halted and all invited to dismount anddrink, without cost to us. We here spent perhaps an hour, during whichtime numbers of the boys entered stores to purchase small necessaryarticles, and in every instance pay was declined.In due time we went into camp in a post oak grove two miles east ofDallas, a locality, by the way, which is now well within the citylimits. And here we remained for some time.Eight other organized companies were soon camped in differentlocalities in the neighborhood, but we were still one company short.However, as there were many men, including a large squad from KaufmanCounty, some from Cherokee and other counties, on the ground wishing togo with us, and who could not get into the organized companies becausethey were all full, they organized themselves into a tenth company,which completed the necessary number for the regiment.We spent about four weeks in Dallas County, a delay caused in good partby the necessity of waiting for the arrival of a train from San Antoniocarrying United States wagons and mules captured at that post by theConfederates. The time, however, was well spent in daily drills, infeeding, grazing and attending to our horses; and then, too, we werelearning valuable lessons in camp life. While here we had plenty ofrations for ourselves and plenty of forage for the horses.The citizens of Dallas County, as far as we came in contact with them,were very kind to us. Our nearest neighbor was a German butcher by thename of Nusbauman. We used water from the well in his yard and wereindebted to him and his family for many acts of kindness.On one occasion Mrs. Nusbauman complained to Captain Taylor that one ofhis men had borrowed her shears to cut hair with, and would not bringthem back. No, she did not know the name of the offender. The captainthen said, 201CMadame, do you know the man when you see him?201D 201COh, yes.201D201CWell, when he comes to draw water again you sprinkle flour on his backand I will find your shears.201D In a few hours one of the men came outfrom the well with his back covered with flour2014and the shears werepromptly returned.Our next nearest neighbors were a family named Sheppard, who lived afew hundred yards south of our camp, and whose kindness was unbounded.Their house was our hospital for the time we were in their vicinity,and the three young ladies of the family, Misses Jennie Wood, Maggie,and another, were unremitting in their attentions to the sick. On onedamp, drizzly day when I had a chill they heard of it somehow, and inthe afternoon two of them drove up in a buggy and called for me to gohome with them, where I could be sheltered, as we yet had no tents.I went, of course, recovered in one day, convalesced in about threedays, and reluctantly returned to camp. In an effort to do some washingfor myself, I had lost a plain gold ring from my finger, a present fromMiss Cattie Everett of Rusk, and Miss Jennie Wood Sheppard replaced itwith one of her own. This ring was worn by me continually, not onlyduring the war, but for several years after its close.I do not remember the date, but some day near the end of June 201CThe LoneStar Defenders,201D that 201Cgallant little band,201D were formally musteredinto the service of the Confederate States of America, for one year. Wewere subjected to no physical examination, or other foolishness, butevery fellow was taken for better or for worse, and no questions wereasked, except the formal, 201CDo you solemnly swear,201D etc. The company waslettered 201CC,201D Greer2019s Regiment, Texas Cavalry2014afterwards numbered andever afterwards known as the Third Texas Cavalry.

Of these the killed numbered                       14  Died of disease                                    16  Discharged                                         31  Commissioned officers resigned                      3  Missing and never heard of                          2  Deserted                                            7  Survived (commissioned and non-commissioned  officers, 12; privates, 40)                        52                                                     20142014                                                    125Of these recruits, six, the first on the list, came to us in Februaryand March, 1862; the next three joined us in April, 1862; the remainingfour joined us in 1863, while we were in Mississippi.The company consisted mainly of natives of the different SouthernStates, with a few native Texans. Aside from these we had Buxton, fromthe State of Maine; Milligan, from Indiana, and three foreigners,William Hood, an Englishman; John Dunn, Irish, and John Honson, aSwede. Milligan was a printer, and being too poor to buy his outfitwhen he joined us, he was furnished with horse and accouterments by ourfriend, B. Miller, a German citizen of Rusk.CHAPTER IIOFF FOR THE FRONT Organization of Regiment2014Officers2014Accouterment2014On the March2014Taming a Trouble-maker2014Crossing the Red River2014In the Indian Territory2014The Indian Maid2014Fort Smith2014The March to Missouri2014McCulloch2019s Headquarters2014Under Orders2014Preparation for First Battle.AFTER the companies were mustered into the service the regiment wasorganized. Colonel Elkanah Greer was commissioned by the ConfederateWar Department. Walter P. Lane was elected lieutenant-colonel, andGeorge W. Chilton, father of United States Senator Horace Chilton,was made major. M. D. Ecton, first lieutenant of Company B, was madeadjutant, Captain 20142014 Harris, quartermaster, Jas. B. Armstrong, ofHenderson, commissary, and our Dr. W. W. McDugald, surgeon.Thus was organized the first regiment to leave the State of Texas, andone of the best regiments ever in the Confederate service. I wouldnot say that it was the _best_ regiment, as in my opinion the bestregiment and the bravest man in the Confederate Army were hard tofind. That is to say, no one regiment was entitled to be designated201Cthe best regiment,201D as no one of our brave men could rightly bedesignated 201Cthe bravest man in the army.201D Napoleon called Marshal Ney201Cthe bravest of the brave,201D but no one could single out a Confederatesoldier and truthfully say, 201CHe is the bravest man in the army.201D It wasunfortunately true that all our men were not brave and trustworthy,for we had men who were too cowardly to fight, and we had some menunprincipled enough to desert; but taken all in all, for gallantryand for fighting qualities under any and all circumstances, either inadvance or retreat, the regiment deservedly stood in the front rank inall our campaigning.The regiment was well officered, field staff, and line. Colonel Greerwas a gallant man, but unfortunately his mind was too much bent on abrigadier2019s stars; Major Chilton, whenever an opportunity offered,showed himself to be brave and gallant; but Walter P. Lane, ourlieutenant-colonel, was the life of the regiment during our firstyear2019s service. A more gallant man than he never wore a sword, bestrodea war horse, or led a regiment in battle. He was one of the heroes ofSan Jacinto, and a born soldier. In camps, in times when there waslittle or nothing to do, he was not overly popular with the men, butwhen the fighting time came he gained the admiration of everyone.At last the long-looked-for train came2014United States wagons drawnby six-mule teams, poor little Spanish or Mexican mules, driven byMexicans. They brought us tents, camp kettles, mess pans and suchthings, and for arms, holster pistols. We were furnished with twowagons to the company and were given Sibley tents,2014large round tentsthat would protect sixteen men with their arms and accouterments,2014apair of holster pistols apiece, and a fair outfit of 201Ccooking tricks.201DWe were then formed into messes of sixteen men each, and each messwas provided with the Sibley tent, the officers being provided withwall tents. Fairly mounted, we were pretty well equipped now, our chiefdeficiency being the very poor condition of the mules and the lackof proper arms, for the men, in mustering, had gathered up shotguns,rifles, and any kind of gun obtainable at home, many of them beingwithout a firearm of any kind. A large number had had huge knives madein the blacksmith shops, with blade eighteen to twenty-four incheslong, shaped something like a butcher2019s cleaver, keen-edged, with astout handle, a weapon after the order of a Cuban machete. These werecarried in leather scabbards, hung to the saddle, and with these deadlyweapons the boys expected to ride through the ranks of the Federalarmies and chop down the men right and left. Now, however, to thisequipment were added the pair of holster pistols. These very large,brass-mounted, single-barreled pistols2014with barrels about a footlong2014carried a large musket ball, and were suspended in holsters thatfitted over the horn of the saddle, thus placing them in a convenientposition for use. In addition to all this, every fellow carried a grassrope at least forty feet long and an iron stake pin. These latter werefor staking out the horses to graze, and many was the untrained horsethat paid dear for learning the art of 201Cwalking the rope,201D for aneducated animal would never injure himself in the least.All things being ready, we now started on our long march, accompaniedby Captain J. J. Goode2019s battery, which had been organized at Dallas,to join General Ben McCulloch in northwestern Arkansas, where he,with what forces he had been able to gather, was guarding our Arkansasfrontier. Leaving Dallas on the2014day of July, we moved via McKinney andSherman, crossing Red River at Colbert2019s ferry, thence by the overlandmail route through the Indian Territory to Fort Smith, Ark., andbeyond. We made moderate marches, the weather being very warm, and wethen had no apparent reason for rapid movements.When near McKinney we stopped two or three days. Here our man fromthe State of Maine began to give us trouble. When sober, Buxtonwas manageable and a useful man to the company, but when he was inliquor, which was any time he could get whisky, he was troublesome,quarrelsome, and dangerous, especially to citizens. One afternoonCaptain Taylor and myself rode into McKinney, where we found Buxtondrunk and making trouble. The captain ordered him to camp, but hecontumaciously refused to go. We managed to get him back to the rear ofa livery stable, near a well, and Captain Taylor forced him down acrossa mound of fertilizer2014holding him there. Then he ordered me to pourwater on Buxton, which I did most copiously. I drew bucket after bucketof cold water from the well and poured it upon Buxton2019s prostrate,soldierly form, until he was thoroughly cooled and partially sobered,when the captain let him up and again ordered him to camp2014and he went,cursing and swearing vengeance. This man, after giving us a good dealof trouble from time to time until after the battle of Elkhorn in thespring of 1862, was jailed in Fort Smith for shooting a citizen in thestreet, and here we left him and crossed the Mississippi River. He madehis escape from jail and followed us to the State of Mississippi, whenLieutenant-Colonel Lane ordered him out of camp. He afterwards returnedto Rusk, where he was killed one day by a gunshot wound, but by whom noone seemed to know.We passed through Sherman early in the morning, and I stopped tohave my horse shod, overtaking the command at Colbert2019s ferry in theafternoon, when they were crossing Red River. The day was fair, theweather dry and hot. The river, very low now, had high banks, and inriding down from the south side you came on to a wide sandbar extendingto a narrow channel running against the north bank, where a smallferryboat was carrying the wagons and artillery across. A few yardsabove the ferry the river was easily fordable, so the horsemen had allcrossed and gone into camp a mile beyond the river, as had most of thewagons. I rode to the other side and stopped on the north bank to watchoperations.All the wagons but one had been ferried over, and this last one hadbeen driven down on the sandbar near the ferry landing, waiting forthe boat2019s return, while two pieces of artillery were standing nearby on the sandbar. Suddenly I heard a roaring sound up the river,as if a wind storm was coming. I looked in that direction and saw averitable flood rushing down like a mighty wave of the sea, roaringand foaming as it came. The driver of the team standing near the watersaw it and instinctively began turning his team to drive out, but,realizing that this would be impossible, he detached his mules andwith his utmost efforts was only able to save the team, while everyavailable man had to lend assistance in order to save the two pieces ofartillery. In five minutes2019 time, perhaps, the water had risen fifteento eighteen feet, and the banks were full of muddy, rushing water, andremained so as long as we were there. The wagon, which belonged tothe quartermaster, was swept off by the tide and lost, with all itscontents. It stood in its position until the water rose to the top ofthe cover, when it floated off.After camping for the night, we moved on. As we were now in the IndianTerritory, the young men were all on the look-out for the beautifulIndian girls of whom they had read so much, and I think some of themhad waived the matter of engagement before leaving home until theycould determine whether they would prefer marrying some of the prettygirls that were so numerous in this Indian country. We had not gonefar on our march when we met a Chickasaw damsel. She was rather youngin appearance, of medium height, black unkempt hair, black eyes,high cheekbones, and was bare-headed and barefooted. Her dress wasof some well-worn cotton fabric, of a color hard to define, ratheran earthy color. In style it was of the extreme low neck and shortkind, and a semi-bloomer. Of other wearing apparel it is unnecessaryto speak, unless you wish a description of another Indian. This onewas too sensible to weight herself with a multiplicity of garments inJuly. She was a regular middle of the roader, as she stuck close tothat part of the Territory strictly. As we were marching by twos weseparated and left her to that part of the highway which she seemed tolike best. She continued her walk westwardly as we continued our marcheastwardly, turning her head right and left, to see what manner ofwhite soldiers the Confederate Government was sending out. This gaveall an opportunity to glimpse at her charms. Modestly she walked alongwithout speaking to any of us, as we had never been introduced to her.Only one time did I hear her speak a word, and that was apparently toherself. As Lieutenant Daniel passed her with his long saber rattling,she exclaimed, in good English: 201C_Pretty white man!_2014got big knife!201DAs we went marching on the conversation became more general; that is,more was said about the beautiful country, the rich lands and finecattle, and not so much about beautiful Indian girls. But every fellowkept his eye to the front, expecting we would meet scores of girls,perhaps hundreds, but all were disappointed, as this was the onlyfull-blooded Indian we met in the highway from Colbert2019s ferry to FortSmith. The fact is, the Indians shun white people who travel the mainroad. Away out in the prairie some two hundred yards you will findIndian trails running parallel with the road, and the Indians keepto these trails to avoid meeting the whites. If they chance to livein a hut near the road you find no opening toward the road, and, ifapproached, they will deny that they can speak English, when, in fact,they speak it readily and plainly.One day I came up with one of our teamsters in trouble. He needed an axto cut down a sapling, so I galloped back to an Indian2019s hut near by,and as there was no enclosure, rode around to the door. The Indian cameout and I asked him to lend me an ax a few minutes. He shook his headand said, 201CMe no intender,201D again and again, and this was the only wordI could get out of him until I dismounted and picked up the ax, whichwas lying on the ground near the door. He then began, in good English,to beg me not to take his ax. I carried it to the teamster, however,but returned it to the Indian in a few minutes.There are, or were then, people of mixed blood living along theroad in good houses and in good style, where travelers could findentertainment. Numbers of these had small Confederate flags flying overthe front gateposts2014and all seemed to be loyal to our cause. Two youngChoctaws joined one of our companies and went with us, one of themremaining with us during the war, and an excellent soldier he was, too.At Boggy Depot the ladies presented us with a beautiful flag, which wascarried until it was many times pierced with bullets, the staff shot intwo, and the flag itself torn into shreds. Arriving at Big Blue River,we lost one or two horses in crossing, by drowning. But finally wereached Fort Smith, on a Saturday, remaining there until Monday morning.While in the Choctaw Nation our men had the opportunity of attending anIndian war dance, and added to their fitness for soldiers by learningthe warwhoop, which many of them were soon able to give just as realIndians do.Fort Smith, a city of no mean proportions, is situated on the southbank of the Arkansas River, very near the line of the Indian Territory.Another good town, Van Buren, is situated on the north bank of theriver, five miles below Fort Smith. While we were at Fort Smith orderscame from General McCulloch, then in southwest Missouri, to cut loosefrom all incumbrances and hasten to his assistance as rapidly aspossible, as a battle was imminent. Consequently, leaving all trains,baggage, artillery, all sick and disabled men and horses to follow usas best they could, we left on Monday morning in the lightest possiblemarching order, for a forced march into Missouri. Our road led acrossBoston Mountain, through Fayetteville and Cassville, on towardsSpringfield. Crossing the river at Van Buren, we began the march overthe long, hot, dry, and fearfully dusty road. As we passed through VanBuren I heard 201CDixie201D for the first time, played by a brass band. Someof the boys obtained the words of the song, and then the singers gaveus 201CDixie201D morning, noon, and night, and sometimes between meals. Thismarch taxed my physical endurance to the utmost, and in the evening,when orders came to break ranks and camp, I sometimes felt as if Icould not march one mile farther. The first or orderly sergeant andsecond sergeant having been left behind with the train, the orderlysergeant2019s duties fell upon me, which involved looking after forage andrations, and other offices, after the day2019s march.On Saturday noon we were at Cassville, Mo. That night we marched nearlyall night, lying down in a stubble field awhile before daylight, wherewe slept two or three hours. About ten o2019clock Sunday morning, tired,dusty, hungry, and sleepy, we went into camp in the neighborhoodof General McCulloch2019s headquarters, in a grove of timber near abeautiful, clear, little stream. The first thing we did was to lookafter something to eat for ourselves and horses, as we had had no foodsince passing Cassville, and only a very light lunch then. The nextthing was to go in bathing, and wash our clothes, as we had had nochange, and then to get some longed-for sleep. In the meantime ColonelGreer had gone up to General McCulloch2019s headquarters to report ourarrival. I was not present at the interview, but I imagine it ransomething like this, as they knew each other well. Colonel Greer wouldsay 201CHello, General! How do you do, sir? Well, I am here to inform youthat I am on the ground, here in the enemy2019s country, with my regimentof Texas cavalry, eleven hundred strong, well mounted and armed to theteeth with United States holster pistols, a good many chop knives, andseveral double-barreled shotguns. Send Lyons word to turn out his Dutchregulars, Kansas jayhawkers and Missouri home guards, and we2019ll clean2019em up and drive 2019em from the State of Missouri.201D201CVery well, very well, Colonel; go back and order your men to cook upthree days2019 rations, get all the ammunition they can scrape up in theneighborhood, and be in their saddles at eleven o2019clock to-night, and Iwill have them at Dug Springs at daylight to-morrow morning and turnthem loose on the gentlemen you speak of.201DAny way, whatever the interview was, we had barely stretched out ourweary limbs and folded our arms to sleep when the sergeant-major, thatfellow that so often brings bad news, came tripping along throughthe encampment, hurrying from one company2019s headquarters to another,saying: 201CCaptain, it2019s General McCulloch2019s order that you have your mencook up three days2019 rations, distribute all the ammunition they can getand be in their saddles, ready to march on the enemy, at eleven o2019clockto-night.201DSleep? Oh, no! Where2019s the man who said he was sleepy? Cook three days2019rations? Oh, my! And not a cooking vessel in the regiment! But nevermind about that, it2019s a soldier2019s duty to obey orders without askingquestions. I drew and distributed the flour and meat, and left the mento do the cooking while I looked after the ammunition. Here the menlearned to roll out biscuit dough about the size and shape of a snake,coil it around a ramrod or a small wooden stick, and bake it before thefire.This Sunday afternoon and night, August 4, was a busy time in our camp.Some were cooking the rations, some writing letters, some one thing,and some another; all were busy until orders came to saddle up. We werecamped on the main Springfield road, and General Lyon, with his army,was at Dug Springs, a few miles farther up the same road. We were tomarch at eleven o2019clock and attack him at daylight Monday morning.There already had been some skirmishing between our outposts and hisscouts. We had never been in battle, and we were nervous, restless,sleepless for the remainder of the day and night after receiving theorders.Some of the things that occurred during the afternoon and night wouldhave been ludicrous had not the whole occasion been so serious. In myefforts to obtain and distribute all the ammunition I could procure Iwas around among the men from mess to mess during all this busy time.Scores of letters were being written by firelight to loved ones athome, said letters running something like this:  CAMP 20142014, Mo., Aug. 4, 1861.  MY DEAR 20142014: We arrived at General McCulloch2019s headquarters about 10 A. M. to-day, tired, dusty, hungry, and sleepy, after a long, forced march from Fort Smith, Ark. We are now preparing for our first battle. We are under orders to march at eleven o2019clock to attack General Lyon2019s army at daylight in the morning. All the boys are busy cooking up three days2019 rations. I am very well. If I survive to-morrow2019s battle I will write a postscript, giving you the result. Otherwise this will be mailed to you as it is.  Yours affectionately,  20142014 20142014Numbers of the boys said to me: 201CNow, Barron, if I am killed to-morrowplease mail this letter for me.201D One said: 201CBarron, here is my goldwatch. Take it, and if I am killed to-morrow please send it to mymother.201D Another said: 201CBarron, here is a gold ring. Please takecare of it, and if I am killed to-morrow I want you to send it to mysister.201D Another one said: 201CBarron, if I am killed to-morrow I want youto send this back to my father.201D At last it became funny to me thateach seemed to believe in the probability of his being killed the nextday, and were making nuncupative wills, naming me as executor in everycase, without seeming to think of the possibility of _my_ being killed.During the remainder of our four years2019 service, with all the fightingwe had to do, I never again witnessed similar preparations for battle.CHAPTER IIIOUR FIRST BATTLEOn the March2014Little York Raid2014Under Fire2014Our First Battle2014OakHill (Wilson2019s Creek)2014Death of General Lyon2014Our First Charge2014EnemyRetires2014Impressions of First Battle2014Death of Young Willie2014Horrors ofa Battlefield2014Troops Engaged2014Casualties.WELL, eleven o2019clock came, we mounted our horses and rode out on theroad to Dug Springs, under orders to move very quietly, and to observethe strictest silence2014and, when necessary, we were not even to talkabove a whisper. The night was dark and we moved very slowly. Aboutthree o2019clock in the morning an orderly came down the column carrying along sheet of white muslin, tearing off narrow strips, and handing themto the men, one of which each man was required to tie around his leftarm. From our slow, silent movement I felt as if we were in a funeralprocession, and the white sheet reminded me of a winding sheet for thedead. As we were not uniformed these strips were intended as a mark ofthe Confederate soldiers, so we might avoid killing our own men in theheat and confusion of battle.At daylight we were halted and informed that General Lyon2019s forces hadwithdrawn from Dug Springs. After some little delay our army moved onin the direction of Springfield, infantry and artillery in the road andthe cavalry on the flank,2014that is, we horsemen took the brush andmarched parallel with the road, in order to guard against ambush andsurprises. We moved slowly in this manner nearly all day without comingup with the enemy2014at noon we took a short rest, and dinner, and heremany of us consumed the last of our three days2019 rations.Along in the afternoon, as we were considerably ahead of the infantry,we filed into the road and were moving slowly along, when suddenly weheard firing in our rear. Of course every one supposed the infantryhad come up with the enemy and they were fighting. We were immediatelyhalted, and Lieutenant-Colonel Lane came galloping back down the columnshouting, 201CTurn your horses around, men, and go like h20142014l the otherway.201D Instantly the column was reversed, and the next minute we werefollowing Colonel Lane at full speed. For two or three miles we ranour tired horses down the dusty road, only to learn that some of theinfantry, who had stopped to camp, were firing off their guns simply tounload them.We then retraced our steps and moved on up the road to Wilson2019s Creek,nine miles from Springfield, and camped on the ground that was to beour first battlefield. We came to the premises of a Mr. Sharp, situatedon the right hand or east side of the road. Just beyond his house, downthe hill, the creek crossed the road and ran down through his place,back of his house and lot. On the left hand or west side of the roadwere rough hills covered with black jack trees, rocks, and considerableunderbrush. Before coming to his dwelling we passed through his lotgates down in the rear of his barn and premises, and camped in a stripof small timber growing along the creek. In the same enclosure, infront and south of us, was a wide, uncultivated field, with a gradualupgrade all the way to the timber back of the field. Here we lived onour meager rations for several days. In the meantime the whole armythen in Missouri, including General Sterling Price2019s command, wasconcentrated in the immediate vicinity.One day during the week we heard that a company of Missouri homeguards, well armed, were at Little York, a small village six orseven miles west from our camps. Now, the home guards were Northernsympathizers, so one afternoon our company and another of the regiment,by permission, marched to Little York on a raid, intending to capturethe company and secure their arms. We charged into the town, but theenemy we sought was not there, and we could find but four or fivesupposed members of the company. Anyway, we chased and captured everyman in town who ran from us, including the surgeon of the command, whowas mounted on a good horse, being the only man mounted in the company.Several of the boys had a chase after him, capturing his horse, whichwas awarded to John B. Long, who, however, did not enjoy his ownershipvery long, for the animal was killed in our first battle. We thensearched for arms, but found none.In one of the storehouses we found a large lot of pig lead, estimatedat 15,000 pounds. This we confiscated for the use of the ConfederateArmy. In order to move it, we pressed into service the only twowagons we could find with teams, but so over-loaded one of themthat the wheels broke down when we started off. We then carried thelead on our horses,2014except what we thought could be hauled in theremaining wagon,2014out some distance and hid it in a thicket of hazelnutbushes. We then, with our prisoners and the one wagon, returned tocamp. When the prisoners were marched up to regimental headquartersLieutenant-Colonel Lane said, 201CTurn them out of the lines and let themgo. I would rather fight them than feed them.201DThis raiding party of two companies that made the descent uponLittle York was commanded by Captain Taylor, and the raid resulted,substantially, as I have stated. Nevertheless, even the next day wild,exaggerated stories of the affair were told, and believed by manymembers of our own regiment as well as other portions of the army, andin Victor Rose2019s 201CHistory of Ross2019s Brigade,201D the following versionof the little exploit may be read: 201CCaptain Frank Taylor, of CompanyC, made a gallant dash into a detachment guarding a train loadedwith supplies for Lyon, routing the detachment, taking a number ofprisoners, and capturing the entire train.201D And 201Cthe historian201D was amember of Company A, Third Texas Cavalry! From this language one wouldinfer that Captain Taylor, alone and unaided, had captured a supplytrain with its escort!On Friday, August 9, the determination was reached to move onSpringfield and attack General Lyon. We received orders to cookrations, have our horses saddled and be ready to march at nine o2019clockP. M. At nine o2019clock we were ready to mount, but by this time a slightrain was falling, and the night was very dark and threatening. We201Cstood to horse,201D as it were, all night, waiting for orders that nevercame. The infantry, also under similar orders, slept on their arms. Ofcourse our men, becoming weary with standing and waiting, lay down atthe feet of their horses, reins in hand, and slept. Daylight found someof the men up, starting little fires to prepare coffee for breakfast,while the majority were sleeping on the ground, and numbers of ourhorses, having slipped their reins from the hands of the sleepingsoldiers, were grazing in the field in front of the camp.Captain Taylor had ridden up to regimental headquarters to ask forinstructions or orders, when the enemy opened fire upon us with abattery stationed in the timber just back of the field in our front,and the shells came crashing through the small timber above our heads.And as if this were a signal, almost instantly another battery openedfire on General Price2019s camp. Who was responsible for the blunder thatmade it possible for us to be thus surprised in camp, I cannot say.It was said that the pickets were ordered in, in view of our moving,at nine o2019clock the night before, and were not sent out again; butthis was afterwards denied. If we had any pickets on duty they werecertainly very inefficient. But there is no time now to inquire of thewhys and wherefores.Captain Taylor now came galloping back, shouting: 201CMount your horsesand get into line!201D There was a hustling for loose horses, a rapidmounting and very soon the regiment was in line by companies in theopen field in front of the camps. It was my duty now to 201Cform thecompany,201D the same as if we were going out to drill; that is, beginningon the right, I rode down the line requiring each man to call out hisnumber, counting, one, two, three, four; one, two, three, four, untilthe left was reached. This gave every man his place for the day, andevery man was required to keep his place. If ordered to march by twos,the horses were wheeled to the right, number 2 forming on the right ofnumber 1; if order to for fours, numbers 3 and 4 moved rapidly up onthe right of numbers 1 and 2, and so on. This being done in the face ofthe aforesaid battery, with no undue haste, was quite a trying ordealto new troops who had never before been under fire, but the men stoodit admirably.As soon as we were formed we moved out by twos, with orders to crossthe Springfield road to the hills beyond, where General Ben McCulloch2019sinfantry, consisting of the noble Third Louisiana and the Arkansastroops, some three thousand in all, were hotly engaged with GeneralLyon2019s command. General Lyon was personally in front of GeneralSterling Price2019s army of Missouri State Guards, being personally incommand of one wing of the Federal Army (three brigades), and Sigel,who was senior colonel, commanded the other wing (one brigade). GeneralMcCulloch was in command of the Confederate troops and General Price ofthe Missourians.We moved out through Mr. Sharp2019s premises as we had come in, butcoming to the road we were delayed by the moving trains and thehundreds of unarmed men who were along with General Price2019s army,rushing in great haste from the battlefield. The road being socompletely filled with the mass of moving trains and men rushingpell-mell southward, it cost us a heroic effort to make our way across.In this movement the rear battalion of the regiment, under MajorChilton, was cut off from us, and while they performed good serviceduring part of the day, we saw no more of them until the battle ended.By the time we crossed the road the battle had become general, and thefire of both artillery and musketry was constant and terrific. Themorning was bright and clear and the weather excessively warm, and aswe had been rushed into battle without having time to get breakfastor to fill our canteens, we consequently suffered from both hungerand thirst. After crossing the road we moved up just in the rear ofour line of infantry, and for five hours or more were thus held inreserve, slowly moving up in column as the infantry lines surged tothe left, while the brave Louisiana and Arkansas troops stood theirground manfully against the heavy fire of musketry and artillery. Asour position was farther down the hill than that occupied by the lineof infantry, we were in no very great danger, as the enemy2019s shot andshell usually passed over us, but, nevertheless, during the whole timethe shots were passing very unpleasantly near our heads, with somedamage, too, as a number of the men were wounded about the head. Onemember of Company C was clipped across the back of the neck with aminie ball. After hours of a most stubborn contest our infantry showedsome signs of wavering. Colonel Greer at this critical moment led usup rapidly past their extreme left,2014had us wheel into line, and thenordered us to charge the enemy2019s infantry in our front. With a yellall along the line, a yell largely mixed with the Indian warwhoop, wedashed down that rough, rocky hillside at a full gallop right into theface of that solid line of well-armed and disciplined infantry. It wasevidently a great surprise to them, for though they emptied their gunsat us, we moved so rapidly that they had no time to reload, and broketheir lines and fled in confusion. The battery that had been playingon our infantry all day was now suddenly turned upon us, otherwisewe could have ridden their infantry down and killed or captured manyof them, but we were halted, and moved out by the left flank fromunder the fire of their battery. Their guns were now limbered up andmoved off, and their whole command was soon in full retreat towardsSpringfield. During the engagement General Nathaniel Lyon had beenkilled, and the battle, after about seven hours2019 hard fighting, was atan end. The field was ours.Thus ended our first battle. Would to God it had been our last, and thelast of the war! General McCulloch called it 201CThe Battle of Oak Hill,201Dbut the Federals called it 201CThe Battle of Wilson2019s Creek.201DThis first battle was interesting to me in many ways. I had beenreading of them since my childhood and looking at pictures ofbattlefields during and after the conflict, but to see a battle inprogress, to hear the deafening roar of artillery, and the terrible,ceaseless rattle of musketry; to see the rapid movements of troops,hear the shouts of men engaged in mortal combat, and to realize thesensation of being a participant, and then after hours of doubtfulcontest to see the enemy fleeing from the field2014all this was grand andterrible. But while there is a grandeur in a battle, there are manyhorrors, and unfortunately the horrors are wide-spread2014they go home tothe wives, fathers, mothers, and sisters of the slain.After the battle was over we were slowly moving in column acrossthe field unmolested, but being fired on by some of the enemy2019ssharpshooters, who were keeping up a desultory fire at long range,when young Mr. Willie, son of Judge A. H. Willie, a member of CompanyA, which was in advance of us, came riding up the column, passing us.I was riding with Captain Taylor at the head of our company, and justas Willie was passing us a ball from one of the sharpshooters2019 riflesstruck him in the left temple, and killed him. But for his position theball would have struck me in another instant.After all the Federals capable of locomotion had left the field, wewere moved up the road on which Sigel had retreated, as far as a millsome five miles away, where we had ample witness of the executiondone by our cavalry2014dead men in blue were strewn along the road in ahorrible manner. On returning, late in the afternoon, we were orderedback to the camp we had left in the morning. As we had witnessedthe grandeur of the battle, Felps and myself concluded to ride overthe field and see some of its horrors. So we rode leisurely over thefield and reviewed the numerous dead, both men and horses, and the fewwounded who had not been carried to the field hospitals. General Lyon2019sbody had been placed in an ambulance by order of General McCulloch,and was on its way to Springfield, where it was left at the house ofColonel Phelps. His horse lay dead on the field, and every lock ofhis gray mane and tail was clipped off by our men and carried off assouvenirs.Further on we found one poor old Missouri home guard who was wounded.He had dragged himself up against a black jack tree and was waitingpatiently for some chance of being cared for. We halted and werespeaking to him, when one of his neighbors, a Southern sympathizer,came up, recognized him and began to abuse him in a shameful manner.201COh, you d20142014d old scoundrel,201D he said, 201Cif you had been where youought to have been, you wouldn2019t be in the fix you are in now.201D Theywere both elderly men, and evidently lived only a few miles away, asthe Southerner had had time to come from his home to see the result ofthe battle. I felt tempted to shoot the old coward, and thus put themon an equality, and let them quarrel it out. But as it seemed enoughmen had been shot for one day, we could only shame him and tell himthat if he had had the manliness to take up his gun and fight for whathe thought was right, as his neighbor had done, he would not be thereto curse and abuse a helpless and wounded man, and that he should notinsult him or abuse him any more while we were there. We continued ourride until satisfied for that time, and for all time, so far as I wasconcerned, with viewing a battlefield just after the battle, unlessduty demands it.Our train came up at night, bringing us, oh, so many letters fromour post office at Fort Smith, but the day2019s doings, the fatigue,hunger, thirst, heat, and excitement had overcome me so completelythat I opened not a letter until the morning. Reckoning up the day2019scasualties in Company C, we found four men and fifteen horses had beenshot; Leander W. Cole was mortally wounded, and died in Springfield afew days later; J. E. Dillard was shot in the leg and in allusion tohis long-leggedness it was said he was shot two and one half feet belowthe knee and one and one half feet above the ankle; T. Wiley Robertswas slightly wounded in the back of the head, and P. C. Couplandslightly wounded. Some of the horses were killed and others wounded.Roger Q. Mills and Dr. 20142014 Malloy, two citizens of Corsicana, werewith us in this battle, having overtaken us on the march, and remainedwith us until it was over, then returning home. Roger Q. Mills wasafterwards colonel of the Tenth Texas Infantry. Dr. Malloy was captainof a company, and fell while gallantly fighting at the head of hiscompany in one of the battles west of the Mississippi River.I will not attempt to give the number of troops engaged, as theofficial reports of the battle written by the officers in command failto settle that question. General Price reported that he had 5221effective men with 15 pieces of artillery. General McCulloch2019s brigadehas been estimated at 4000 men, with no artillery, and this officer2019sconclusion was that the enemy had 9000 to 10,000 men, and that theforces of the two armies were about equal. The Federal officers intheir reports greatly exaggerated our strength, and, I think, greatlyunderestimated theirs, especially so since, General Lyon being killed,it devolved upon the subordinates to make the reports. Major S. D.Sturgis, who commanded one of Lyon2019s brigades, says their 3700 menattacked an army of 23,000 rebels under Price and McCulloch, that theirloss in killed, wounded, and missing was 1235, and he supposed therebel loss was 3000. Major J. M. Schofield, General Lyon2019s adjutant,says their 5000 men attacked the rebel army of 20,000. General Fr00E9mont,afterwards, in congratulating the army on their splendid conduct inthis battle, says their 4300 men met the rebel army of 20,000. Theygive the organization of their army without giving the numbers. GeneralLyon had four brigades, consisting, as they report, of six regiments,three battalions, seven companies, 200 Missouri home guards and threebatteries of artillery, many of their troops being regulars. Their armycame against us in two columns.[Illustration: LIEUTENANT-COLONEL JILES S. BOGGESSThird Texas Cavalry]General Lyon, with three brigades and two batteries, Totten2019s sixpieces, and Dubois, with four, came down the Springfield road andattacked our main army in front. Colonel Franz Sigel, with one brigadeand one light battery, marched down to the left, or east of the roadand into our rear, and attacked the cavalry camp with his artillery, ashas already been stated. Poor Sigel! it would be sufficient to describehis disastrous defeat to merely repeat their official reports. But Iwould only say that his battery was lost and his command scatteredand driven from the field in utter confusion and demoralization inthe early part of the day and that it was followed some five miles byour cavalry and badly cut up, he himself escaping capture narrowly byabandoning his carriage and colors and taking to a cornfield. It wassaid by the Federals that he reached Springfield with one man beforethe battle was ended. But the forces led by the brave and gallant Lyonfought bravely. The losses are given officially as follows: Federals:killed, 223; wounded, 721; missing, 291. Total, 1235. Confederates:killed, 265; wounded, 800; missing, 30. Total, 1095.CHAPTER IVTHE WAR IN MISSOURI Personal Characteristics2014Two Braggarts2014Joe Welch2014William Hood2014We Enter Springfield2014Bitter Feeling in Missouri2014Company Elections2014Measles and Typhoid2014Carthage, and My Illness There2014We Leave Carthage2014Death of Captain Taylor2014Winter Quarters2014Furloughed2014Home Again.A BATTLE2014or danger2014will often develop some characteristics thatnothing else will bring out.One Gum was a shabby little man, mounted on a shabby little mustangpony; in fact his horse was so shabby that he would tie him, whilewe were at Dallas, away off in the brush in a ravine and carry hisforage half a mile to feed him rather than have him laughed at. Gumwas a Missourian, and got into the company somehow, with his fiddle,and aside from his fiddling he was of little use in camps. During thetime we were kept slowly moving along in the rear of our infantry,engaged mainly in the unprofitable business of dodging balls andshells that were constantly whizzing near our heads, Captain Taylorwas very anxious that his company should act well under fire andwould frequently glance back, saying: 201CKeep your places, men.201D Gum,however, was out of place so often he finally became personal, 201CKeepin your place, Gum.201D At this Gum broke ranks and came trotting up onhis little pony, looking like a monkey with a red cap on, for, havinglost his hat, he had tied a red cotton handkerchief around his head.When opposite the captain he reined up, and with a trembling frameand in a quivering voice, almost crying, he said: 201CCaptain, I _can2019t_keep my place. I am a coward, and I can2019t help it.201D Captain Taylorsaid, sympathetically: 201CVery well, Gum; go where you please.201D It sohappened that a few days later we passed his father2019s house, nearMount Vernon, and the captain allowed him to stop and remain with hisfather. And thus he was discharged. At this stage of the war we hadno army regulations, no 201Cred tape201D in our business. If a captain sawfit to discharge one of his men he told him to go, and he went withoutreference to army headquarters or the War Department. I met Gum inNovember, fleeing from the wrath of the home guards, as a man who hadbeen in the Confederate Army could not live in safety in Missouri.One of our men, in the morning when I was forming the company, was soagitated that it was a difficult matter to get him to call his number.During the day a ball cut a gash about skin deep and two inches inlength across the back of his neck, just at the edge of his hair. As aresult of this we were two years in getting this man under fire again,though he would not make an honest confession like Gum, but wouldmanage in some mysterious way to keep out of danger. When at last wesucceeded in getting him in battle at Thompson2019s Station in 1863, heran his iron ramrod through the palm of his right hand and went to therear. Rather than risk himself in another engagement he deserted, inthe fall of that year, and went into the Federal breastworks in frontof Vicksburg and surrendered. This man was named Wiley Roberts.Captain Hale, of Company D, was rather rough-hewn, but a brave,patriotic old man, having not the least patience with a thief, acoward, or a braggart. While he had some of the bravest men in hiscompany that any army could boast of, he had one or two, at least, thatwere not among these, as the two stalwart bullies who were exceedinglyboastful of their prowess, of the ease with which Southern men couldwhip Northerners, five to one being about as little odds as they caredto meet. This type of braggart was no novelty, for every soldier hadheard that kind of talk at the beginning of the war. While we weremoving out in the morning when Sigel2019s battery was firing and CaptainHale was coolly riding along at the head of his company, these twomen came riding rapidly up, one hand holding their reins while theother was pressed across the stomach, as if they were in great misery,saying, when they sighted their commander: 201CCaptain Hale, where must wego? we are sick.201D Captain Hale looked around without uttering a wordfor a moment, his countenance speaking more indignation than languagecould express. At last he said, in his characteristic, emphatic manner:201CGo to h20142014l, you d20142014d cowards! You were the only two fighting menI had until now we are in a battle, and you2019re both sick. I don2019t carewhen you go.201D Other incidents could be given where men in the regimentwere tried and found wanting, but the great majority were brave andgallant men who never shirked duty or flinched from danger.An instance of the opposite character may be told of Joe Welch. Joewas a blacksmith, almost a giant in stature. Roughly guessing, I wouldsay he was six feet two inches in height, weighing about 240 pounds,broad-shouldered, raw-boned, with muscles that would laugh at a sledge.Joe had incurred the contempt of the company by acting in a verycowardly manner, as they thought, in one or two little personal affairsbefore we reached Missouri. But when we went into battle Joe was there,as unconcerned and cool, apparently, as if he was only going into hisshop to do a day2019s work; and when we made our charge down that roughhillside when the enemy2019s bullets were coming as thick as hailstones,one of Joe2019s pistols jolted out of its holster and fell to the ground.Joe reined in his horse, deliberately dismounted, recovered the pistol,remounted, and rapidly moved up to his place in the ranks. Those whowitnessed the coolness and apparent disregard of danger with which heperformed this little feat felt their contempt suddenly converted intoadmiration.Another one of our men was found wanting, but through no fault of hisown, as he was faithful as far as able. This was William Hood. Hood wasan Englishman, quite small, considerably advanced in years, destituteof physical endurance and totally unfit for the hardships of asoldier2019s life. He was an old-womanish kind of a man, good for cooking,washing dishes, scouring tin plates, and keeping everything nicearound the mess headquarters, but was unsuited for any other part of asoldier2019s duty. Hood strayed off from us somehow during the day, andfor some part of the day was a prisoner, losing his horse, but managedto get back to camp afoot at night, very much depressed in spirits. Thenext morning he was very proud to discover his horse grazing out in thefield two or three hundred yards from the camp. He almost flew to him,but found he was wounded. He came back to Captain Taylor with a verysad countenance, and said: 201CCaptain Taylor, me little 2019orse is woundedright were the 2019air girth goes on 2019im.201D The wound was only slight andas soon as the little 2019orse was in proper traveling condition littleHood was discharged and allowed to return home.As already stated, we returned late in the evening to the camp wehad left in the morning to rest and sleep for the night, for afterthe excitement of the day was over bodily fatigue was very much inevidence. Our train came up about nightfall, but as I was very tired,and our only chance for lights was in building up little brush fires,the opening of my letters was postponed until the bright Sundaymorning, August 11, especially as my mail packet was quite bulky.One large envelope from Huntsville, Ala., contained a letter and anexquisite little Confederate flag some ten or twelve inches long.This was from a valued young lady friend who, in the letter, gave memuch good advice, among other things warning me against being shot inthe back. And I never was. During the day the command marched intoSpringfield, to find that the Federal Army had pushed forward Saturdaynight. They had retreated to Rolla, the terminus of the railroad, andthence returned to St. Louis, leaving us for a long time in undisputedpossession of southwest Missouri, where we had but little to do forthree months but gather forage and care for our horses and teams andperform the routine duties incident to a permanent camp.From Springfield we moved out west a few miles, camping for a few daysat a large spring called Cave Spring. Here several of our men weredischarged and returned home. Among them James R. Taylor, brother ofCaptain, subsequently Colonel, Taylor of the Seventeenth Texas Cavalry,who was killed at the battle of Mansfield, La.Southwest Missouri is a splendid country, abounding in rich lands,fine springs of pure water, and this year, 1861, an abundant crop ofcorn, oats, hay, and such staples had been raised. Nevertheless, avery unhappy state of things existed there during the war, for thepopulation was very much divided in sentiment and sympathy2014some beingfor the North and some for the South, and the antagonism between thefactions was very bitter. Indeed, so intense had the feeling run,the man of one side seemed to long to see his neighbor of the otherside looted and his property destroyed. Men of Southern sympathy havestealthily crept into our camps at midnight and in whispers told uswhere some Union men were to be found in the neighborhood, evidentlywishing and expecting that we would raid them and kill or capture,rob, plunder or do them damage in some terrible manner. Such reportersseemed to be disappointed when we would tell them that we were notthere to make war on citizens, and the Union men themselves seemed tothink we were ready to do violence to all who were not loyal to theSouthern Confederacy. When we chanced to go to one of their housesfor forage, as frequently happened, we could never see the man of thehouse, unless we caught a glimpse of him as he was running to someplace to hide, and no assurance to his family that we would not inany manner mistreat him would overcome the deep conviction that wewould. This bitter feeling and animosity among the citizens grew tosuch intensity, as the war advanced, that life became a misery to thecitizen of Missouri.We moved around leisurely over the country from place to place,foraging and feeding a few days here and a few days there, and in theearly days of September, passing by way of Mount Vernon and Carthage,we found ourselves at Scott2019s Mill, on Cowskin River, near the borderof the Cherokee Nation. At Mount Vernon we witnessed a farce enactedby Company D. Dan Dupree was their first lieutenant, and a very nice,worthy fellow he was, too, but some of his men fell out with him aboutsome trivial matter, and petitioned him to resign, which he did.Captain Hale, supposing possibly they might also be opposed to him,and too diffident to say so, he resigned too, and the other officersfollowed suit, even down to the fourth and last corporal, and forthe time the company was without an officer, either commissioned ornon-commissioned. At this early stage of the war, for an officer toresign was a very simple and easy thing. He had only to say publiclyto his company, 201CI resign,201D and it was so. The company was now formedinto line to prepare for the election of officers, and the mode ofprocedure was as follows: The candidates would stand a few paces infront of the line, their back to the men. The men were then instructedto declare their choice, by standing behind him, one behind the other,and when all votes were counted the result was declared. The outcomeon this occasion was that Captain Hale and all the old officers werere-elected, except Dupree. Later in the year members of Company Apetitioned their captain to resign, but he respectfully declined,and though many of his men were very indignant, we heard no more ofpetitioning officers to resign.While we were camped on the beautiful little Cowskin River measlesattacked our men, and we moved up to Carthage, where we remainedabout eight weeks, during which time we passed through a terriblescourge of measles and typhoid fever. As a result Company C lostfive men, including Captain Taylor. Fortunately we were in a high,healthy country, and met in Carthage a warm-hearted, generous people.In addition to our competent and efficient surgeon and his assistantduring this affliction, we had a number of good physicians, privates inthe regiment, who rendered all the assistance in their power in caringfor the sick. The court house was appropriated as a hospital, and,soon filled to its capacity, the generous citizens received the sickmen into their houses and had them cared for there. How many of theregiment were sick at one time I do not know, but there were a greatmany; the number of dead I never knew. Our surgeon went from house tohouse visiting and prescribing for the sick both day and night, untilit seemed sometimes as if he could not make another round.The day after we reached Carthage I was taken down with a severecase of measles, and glided easily into a case of typhoid fever. Dr.McDugald went personally to find a home for me, and had me conveyed tothe residence of Mr. John J. Scott, a merchant and farmer, where forseven weeks I wasted away with the fever, during all of which time Iwas as kindly and tenderly cared for by Mrs. Scott as if I had been oneof her family; and her little girl Olympia, then about eleven yearsold, was as kind and attentive to me as a little sister could havebeen. My messmate and chum, Thomas J. Johnson, remained with me to waiton me day and night during the entire time, and Dr. McDugald, and alsoDr. Dan Shaw, of Rusk County, were unremitting in their attention. A.B. Summers took charge of my horse, and gave him better attention thanhe did his own. Captain Taylor was also very low at the same time, andwas taken care of at the house of Colonel Ward. The fever had left meand I had been able to sit up in a rocking chair by the fire a littlewhile at a time for a few days, when General Fr00E9mont, who had beenplaced in command of the Federal Army in Missouri, began a movementfrom Springfield in the direction of Fayetteville, Ark., and we weresuddenly ordered away from Carthage. All the available transportationhad to be used to remove the sick, who were taken to Scott2019s Mill. Abuggy being procured for Captain Taylor and myself, our horses werehitched to it and, with the assistance of Tom Johnson and John A. Boyd,we moved out, following the march of the command into Arkansas. Thecommand moved south, via Neosho and Pineville, and dropped down onSugar Creek, near Cross Hollows, confronting General Fr00E9mont, who soonretired to Springfield, and never returned. At Sugar Creek we stoleBen A. Long out of camp, and made our way to Fayetteville, where westopped at the house of Martin D. Frazier, by whose family we were mosthospitably treated. Here Captain Taylor relapsed, and died.Captain Francis Marion Taylor was a noble, brave, and patriotic man,and we were all much grieved at his death. He had been at death2019sdoor in Carthage, and Dr. McDugald then thought he was going to die,telling him so, but he rallied, and when we left there he was muchstronger than I was, being able to drive, while that would have beenimpossible with me. When he relapsed he did not seem to have muchhope of recovering, and after the surgeon, at his own request, hadtold him his illness would terminate fatally, he talked very freelyof his approaching death. He had two little children, a mother, and amother-in-law, Mrs. Wiggins, all of whom he loved very much, and saidhe loved his mother-in-law as much as he loved his mother. He gaveme messages for them, placed everything he had with him (his horse,gold watch, gold rings, sword, and his trunk of clothes) in my charge,with specific instructions as to whom to give them2014his mother, hismother-in-law and his two little children.I continued to improve, but recovered very slowly indeed, and remainedin Fayetteville until the early days of December. The regiment wasordered to go into winter quarters at the mouth of Frog Bayou, onthe north bank of the Arkansas River, twelve miles below Van Buren,and when they had passed through Fayetteville on their way to thedesignated point, I followed, as I was now able to ride on horseback.Cabins were soon erected for the men and stalls for the horses, andhere the main command was at home for the winter. I was furlougheduntil March 1, but as the weather was fine I remained in the camp fortwo weeks before starting on the long home journey to Rusk. Many otherconvalescents were furloughed at this time, so finally, in companywith Dr. W. L. Gammage, who, by the way, had been made surgeon of anArkansas regiment, and two or three members of Company F who lived inCherokee County, I started to Rusk, reaching the end of my journey justbefore Christmas.My first night in Cherokee County was spent at the home of CaptainTaylor2019s noble mother, near Larissa, where I delivered her son2019s lastmessages to her, and told her of his last days. The next day I wenton to Rusk and delivered the messages, horse, watch, etc., to themother-in-law and children. Mr. Wiggins2019s family offered me a homefor the winter, and as I had greatly improved and the winter wasexceedingly mild, I spent the time very pleasantly until ready toreturn to the army. Among other things I brought home the ball thatkilled Leander Cole, and sent it to his mother.CHAPTER VTHE WAR IN MISSOURI2014_Continued_ I Rejoin the Command2014Sleeping in Snow2014Ambushed2014Battle of Elkhorn Tavern (Pea Ridge)2014Capturing a Battery2014Deaths of Generals McCulloch and McIntosh2014Battle Continued2014Casualties2014Keetsville2014Official Reports2014March Southward2014Foraging2014Lost Artillery2014Illness Again.IN the latter part of February, 1862, I left Rusk in company with TomHogg, John Germany, and perhaps one or two more of our furloughed men,for our winter quarters on the Arkansas River. We crossed Red River andtook the road running along the line between Arkansas and the IndianTerritory to Fort Smith. After crossing Red River we began meetingrefugees from Missouri and north Arkansas, on their way to Texas, whotold us that our army was moving northward, and a battle was expectedvery soon. This caused us to push on more rapidly, as we were due toreturn March 1, and were anxious to be in our places with the command.When we reached Van Buren we learned that our whole army was in motion,that a battle was imminent and might occur any day. By this time theweather had grown quite cold, and leaving Van Buren at 9 A. M., we hadto cross Boston Mountain, facing a north wind blowing snow in our facesall day. Nevertheless, we slept fifty miles from there that night,camping with some commissary wagons on the road, a few miles fromFayetteville. Here we learned that the army was camped along the roadbetween there and Fayetteville. The next morning we started on at abrisk gait, but before we could pass the infantry they were filing intothe road. We took to the brush and galloped our horses about six milesand overtook the Third Texas, which was in the advance, now passing outof the northern suburbs of Fayetteville, and found Company C in theadvance guard on the Bentonville road.We advanced slowly that day, without coming in contact with the enemy,and camped that night at Elm Springs, where the snow fell on us allnight. Of course we had no tents, but slept on the ground withoutshelter. This seemed pretty tough to a fellow who, except for a fewfine days in December, had not spent a day in camp since September,during all that time occupying warm, comfortable rooms. Up to this timeI had never learned to sleep with my head covered, but finding it nownecessary, I would first cover my head and face to keep the snow out,stand that as long as I could, then throw the blanket off, when thesnow would flutter down in my face, chilling me so that I could notsleep. So between the two unpleasant conditions I was unable to getany rest at all. Some time before daybreak we saddled up and moved on,the snow being three or four inches deep, and early in the morning wepassed the burning fires of the Federal pickets. By nine o2019clock thestorm had passed, the sun shining brightly, and about ten o2019clock wecame in sight of Bentonville, a distance said to be two miles. We couldplainly see the Federal troops moving about the streets, their brightguns glistening in the sunshine, afterwards ascertained to have beenSigel2019s column of General Curtis2019 army. We were drawn up in line andordered to prepare for a charge. To illustrate what a magic influencean order to charge upon the enemy has, how it sends the sluggish bloodrushing through the veins and livens up the new forces, I will say thatwhile we were standing in line preparing to charge those fellows, I wasso benumbed with cold that I could not cap my pistols. I tried everso hard to do so, but had my life depended upon it I could not havesucceeded. We were thrown into columns of fours and ordered to charge,which we did at a brisk gallop, and before we had gone exceedingone-half mile I had perfect use of my hands, was comfortably warm, anddid not suffer in the least with cold at any time during the rest ofthe day.We charged into the town, but the enemy had all moved out. I suppose itwas the rear of the command that we had seen moving out. That afternoonwe were ambushed by a strong force, and were fired on in the rightflank from a steep, rough hill. We were ordered to charge, which orderwe attempted to obey by wheeling and charging in line up a hill sosteep and rough that only a goat could have made any progress, only tofind our line broken into the utmost confusion and under a murderousfire of infantry and artillery from an invisible enemy behind rocksand trees. In the confusion I recognized the order 201Cdismount and fallinto line!201D I dismounted, but when I fell into what I supposed wasgoing to be the line I found Lieutenant J. E. Dillard and J. B. Murphy,201Cus three, and no more.201D While glancing back I saw the regiment wascharging around on horseback, while the captains of companies wereshouting orders to their men in the vain endeavor to get them into somekind of shape.In the meantime the bullets were coming thick around us threedismounted men, knocking the bark from the hickory trees in ourvicinity into our faces in a lively manner. Finally concluding we coulddo no good without support, we returned to our horses, mounted, andjoined the confusion, and soon managed to move out of range of theenemy2019s guns. Brave old Captain Hale, very much chagrined and mortifiedby this affair, considered the regiment disgraced, and said as muchin very emphatic, but not very choice, English. I do not remember theprecise language he used, but he was quoted as saying: 201CThis hereregiment are disgraced forever! I2019d 2019a2019 rather died right thar than toa give airy inch!201D I do not know how many men we lost in this affair,but Vic. Rose says ten killed and twenty wounded. I remember thatJoe Welch was wounded in the thigh, but I do not remember any othercasualty in Company C. This was reckoned as the first day of the threedays2019 battle of Elkhorn Tavern, or Pea Ridge.General Earl Van Dorn had taken command of the entire army on March2, and conducted the remainder of the campaign to its close. GeneralPrice2019s division consisted of the Missouri troops. General McCullochwas placed in command of the infantry of his old division, consistingof the Third Louisiana, commanded by Colonel Louis Hebert (pronouncedHebair), and the Arkansas infantry, and General James Mcintosh, whohad just been promoted to brigadier-general, commanded the cavalry.Brigadier-General Samuel R. Curtis, who commanded the Federal Army inour front, was concentrating his forces near Elkhorn Tavern and PeaRidge, near the Arkansas and Missouri line.After the ambush and skirmish alluded to above, General Sigel moved onnorthward with his command and we moved on in the same direction, andnear nightfall camped by the roadside. Here, as we had neither foodfor man nor forage for beast, I started out to procure a feed of cornfor my horse, if possible, riding west from camp, perhaps five miles,before I succeeded. For a while at first I searched corncribs, butfinding them all empty I began searching under the beds, and succeededin obtaining fifteen or twenty ears. Part of this I fed to my horse,part of it I ate myself, and carried part of it on for the next night.We were now near the enemy. Leaving camp about two hours beforedaylight, we made a detour to the left, passed the enemy2019s rightflank, and were in his rear near Pea Ridge. General Price, accompaniedby General Van Dorn, passed around his left and gained his rear nearElkhorn Tavern, where General Van Dorn established his headquarters.About 10.30 A. M. we heard General Price2019s guns, as he began theattack. Our cavalry was moving in a southeasterly direction towardthe position of General Sigel2019s command, and near Leetown, in columnsof fours, abreast, the Third Texas on the right, then the Sixth andNinth Texas, Brook2019s Arkansas battalion, and a battalion of ChoctawIndians, forming in all, five columns. Passing slowly through an openfield, a Federal light battery, some five hundred or six hundred yardsto our right, supported by the Third Iowa Cavalry, opened fire uponour flank, killing one or two of our horses with the first shot. Thebattery was in plain view, being inside of a yard surrounding a littlelog cabin enclosed with a rail fence three or four feet high. Just atthis time one of General McCulloch2019s batteries, passing us on its wayto the front, was halted, the Third Texas was moved up in front of it,and were ordered to remain and protect it. Lieutenant-Colonel WalterP. Lane rode out to the front, facing the enemy2019s battery, and callingto Charley Watts, he said: 201CCome here, Charley, and blow the chargeuntil you are black in the face.201D With Watts by his side blowing thecharge with all his might, Lane struck a gallop, when the other fourcolumns wheeled and followed him, the Texans yelling in the usual styleand the Indians repeating the warwhoop, dashing across the field inhandsome style. The Federal cavalry charged out and met them, when abrisk fire ensued for a few minutes; but, scarcely checking their gait,they brushed the cavalry, the Third Iowa, aside as if it was chaff,charged on in face of the battery, over the little rail fence, and werein possession of the guns in less time than it takes to tell the story.In this little affair twenty-five of the Third Iowa Cavalry were killedand a battery captured, but I do not know how many of the gunners werekilled. The Choctaws, true to their instinct, when they found the deadon the field, began scalping them, but were soon stopped, as suchsavagery could not be tolerated in civilized warfare. Still a greatdeal was said by the Federal officers and newspapers about the scalpingof a few of these men, and it was reported that some bodies wereotherwise mutilated. Colonel Cyrus Bussey of the Third Iowa certifiedthat he found twenty-five of his men dead on the field, and that eightof these had been scalped.General McCulloch2019s infantry and artillery soon attacked GeneralSigel2019s command in our front, and the engagement became general allalong the line. The roar of artillery and the rattle of musketry wereterrific all day until dark, with no decisive advantage gained oneither side. The Third Texas was moved up behind Pea Ridge, dismounted,and placed in line of battle just behind the crest of the ridge, tosupport our infantry, a few hundred yards in front of us, with ordersnot to abandon the ridge under any circumstances. Here we remaineduntil late in the afternoon without further orders, in no particulardanger except from the shells from the enemy2019s artillery that came overthe ridge and fell around us pretty constantly. Generals McCullochand McIntosh had both been killed early in the day, and Colonel LouisHebert, who was senior colonel and next in rank, had been captured. Allthis was unknown to us, and also unknown to General Van Dorn, who waswith General Price near Elkhorn Tavern, two or three miles east of ourposition. Late in the afternoon Colonel Greer sent a courier in searchof General McIntosh or General McCulloch, to ask for instructions, ororders, and the sad tidings came back that they were both killed; norcould Colonel Hebert be found.The firing ceased at night, but we remained on the field, uncertain asto the proper thing to do, until a courier who had been sent to GeneralVan Dorn returned about 2 A. M., with orders for all the forces tomove around to General Price2019s position. When this was accomplished itwas near daylight, and we had spent the night without sleep, withoutrations, and without water. General Curtis, perhaps discovering ourmovement, was also concentrating his forces in General Price2019s front.The Confederates made an attack on the enemy early in the morning,and for an hour or two the firing was brisk and spirited, but as ourmen were starved out and their ammunition about exhausted, they wereordered to cease firing. As the Federals also ceased firing, the forceswere withdrawn quietly and in an orderly manner from the field, and wemoved off to the south, moving east of General Curtis, having passedentirely around his army.The number of forces engaged in this battle were not definitely given.General Van Dorn in his report stated that he had less than 14,000 men,and estimated the Federal force at from 17,000 to 24,000, computingour loss at 600 killed and wounded and 200 prisoners, a total of 800.General Curtis reported that his forces engaged consisted of about10,500 infantry and cavalry, with 49 pieces of artillery, and hisstatement of losses, killed, wounded, and missing adds up a total of1384. The future historian, the man who is so often spoken of, is goingto have a tough time if he undertakes to record the truths of the war.When commanding officers will give some facts and then round up theirofficial reports with fiction, conflicts will arise that, it appearsto me, can never be reconciled. A private soldier or a subordinateofficer who participates in a battle can tell little about it beyondwhat comes under his personal observation, which is not a great deal,but he is apt to remember that little very distinctly.In reference to the close of the battle, General Curtis among otherthings said: 201COur guns continued some time after the rebel fire ceasedand the rebels had gone down into the deep caverns through whichthey had begun their precipitate flight. Finally our firing ceased.201DSpeaking of the pursuit he says: 201CGeneral Sigel also followed in thispursuit towards Keetsville.... General Sigel followed some miles northtowards Keetsville, firing on the retreating force that ran that way.201DThen adds: 201CThe main force took the Huntsville road which is directlysouth.201D This is true. Now, I dare say, there never was a more quiet,orderly, and uninterrupted retreat from a battlefield. The Third Texaswas ordered to cover the retreat, and in order to do this properly wetook an elevated position on the battlefield, where we had to remainuntil our entire army moved off and everybody else was on the marchand out of the way. The army moved out, not precipitately, but in aleisurely way, not through 201Cdeep caverns,201D but over high ground inplain view of the surrounding country. Company C was ordered to takethe position of rear guard, in rear of the regiment. The regimentfinally moved out, Company C waiting until it had gone some distance,when the company filed into the road and moved off. And then James E.Dillard and the writer of this remained on the field until the entireConfederate army was out of sight. During all this time not a Federalgun was fired, not a Federal soldier came in view. Nor were we molestedduring the entire day or night, although we moved in a leisurely wayall day, and at night Company C was on picket duty in the rear untilmidnight.Keetsville is a town in Missouri north of the battlefield. Sigel, itwas stated, 201Cfollowed some miles north towards Keetsville, firing onthe retreating force that ran that way.201D There were about twenty-fourpieces of our artillery that got into the Keetsville road throughmistake; they were without an escort, entirely unprotected. After wehad gone about three days2019 march, leaving Huntsville to our left andFayetteville to the right, the Third Texas was sent in search of thisartillery, and, after marching all night and until noon next day,passing through Huntsville, we met them, and escorted them in. Theyhad not been fired on or molested in the least. The Federal officers,however, were not chargeable with all the inaccuracies that crept intoofficial reports.General Van Dorn in his report of this campaign, says: 201COn the 6th weleft Elm Springs for Bentonville.... I therefore endeavored to reachBentonville, eleven miles distant, by rapid march, but the troopsmoved so slowly that it was 11 A. M. before the leading division(Price2019s)2014reached the village, and we had the mortification to seeSigel2019s division, 7000 strong, leaving it as we entered.201DNow, as I have already stated, the Third Texas was in advance, andwe saw Sigel leaving Bentonville long before 11 A. M., and Price2019sdivision never saw them in Bentonville nor anywhere else that day.General Curtis reported that two of his divisions had just reached hisposition, near Pea Ridge, when word came to him that General Sigel, whohad been left behind with a detachment of one regiment, was about tobe surrounded by a 201Cvastly superior force,201D when these two divisionsmarched rapidly back and with infantry and artillery checked the rebeladvance, losing twenty-five men killed and wounded. So this was theforce that ambushed us, and according to this account, Sigel moved outof Bentonville in the morning with one regiment, instead of 7000 men.So the reader of history will never know just how much of fiction he isgetting along with the 201Chistory.201DLeaving the battlefield in the manner stated, we moved very slowly allday. In fact, fatigue, loss of sleep, and hunger had rendered a rapidmovement impossible with the infantry. Our men were so starved thatthey would have devoured almost anything. During the day I saw some ofthe infantry men shoot down a hog by the side of the road, and, cuttingoff pieces of the meat, march on eating the raw bloody pork withoutbread or salt. The country through which we were marching was a poor,mountainous district, almost destitute of anything for the inhabitantsto subsist upon, to say nothing of feeding an army. Stock of any kindappeared to be remarkably scarce. J. E. Dillard managed to get a smallrazor-back pig, that would weigh perhaps twenty-five pounds, strappedit on behind his saddle and thus carried it all day. When we wererelieved of picket duty and went into camp at midnight, he cut it upand divided it among the men. I drew a shoulder-blade, with perhaps asmuch as four ounces of meat on it. This I broiled and ate without saltor bread.We continued the march southward, passing ten or twelve miles eastof Fayetteville. About the fourth day we had been resting, and thecommissary force was out hustling for something to eat, but beforewe got any rations the Third Texas was suddenly ordered to mountimmediately and go in search of our missing artillery. This was in theafternoon, perhaps four o2019clock. Moving in a northeasterly direction,we marched all night on to the headwaters of White River, where thatstream is a mere creek, and I do not think it would be an exaggerationto say that we crossed it twenty times during the night. About 10 A. M.we passed through Huntsville, county seat of Madison County, a smalltown having the appearance of being destitute of everything. By thistime the matter of food had become a very serious question, and weappeared to be in much greater danger of dying from starvation in themountains of northern Arkansas than by the enemy2019s bullets. Our beltshad been tightened until there was no relief in that, and, as if toenhance my own personal suffering, the tantalizing fact occurred to methat I was treading my native heath, so to speak, for I am a nativeof Madison County, and Huntsville had been my home for years, whereto enjoy three squares a day had been an unbroken habit of years. Butto-day I was literally starving in the town of Huntsville, County ofMadison, aforesaid, and not a friendly face could I see, nor coulda morsel of bread be procured for love or patriotism. Passing onwardtwo or three miles, and having learned that the guns were coming, werested, and privately made details to scour the country and beg for alittle food 201Cfor sick and wounded men.201D Tom Johnson went out for ourmess, and the sorrowful tales that were told in behalf of the poorsick and wounded soldiers we were hauling along in ambulances, withnothing with which to feed them, would have melted a heart of stone.The ruse was a success, as the details came in at night with diverssmall contributions made from scant stores for 201Cthe poor sick andwounded men,201D which were ravenously consumed by the well ones. Theartillery shortly afterwards came up and was escorted by us to thecommand. Camping that night a few miles from Huntsville, the artilleryhad taken the wrong road as it left the battlefield, had gone up intoMissouri, and had had a long circuitous drive through the mountains,but otherwise they were all right.After we returned with the guns, the army moved on southward. When wewere again in motion, as there was no further apprehension of beingfollowed by the enemy, hunger having nearly destroyed my respectfor discipline, I left the column by a byroad leading eastwardly,determined to find something to eat. This proved a more difficulterrand than I had expected, for the mountaineers were very poor andapparently almost destitute of supplies. I had traveled twelve orfifteen miles when I rode down the mountain into a little valley, atthe head of Frog Bayou, coming to a good log house owned and occupiedby a Mr. Jones, formerly of Jackson County, Alabama, and a brother ofHosea, Allen, William, and Jesse Jones, good and true men, all of whomI knew. If he had been my uncle I could not have been prouder to findhim. Here I got a good square meal for myself and horse, seasoned witha good hearty welcome. This good, true old man was afterwards murdered,as I learned, for his loyalty to the Confederate cause. After enjoyingmy dinner and a rest, I proceeded on my way, intending to rejoin thecommand that evening; but, missing the road they were on, I met theregiment at our old winter quarters. Thus about the middle of Marchthe Third Texas Cavalry was again housed in the huts we had erected onthe bank of the Arkansas River. I do not know the casualties of theregiment, but as far as I remember Company C had only one man, Jos.Welsh, wounded, and one man, Orderly Sergeant W. M. Caldwell, captured.But as the prisoners were exchanged, our captured men soon returned tous.Thus ended a short campaign which involved much suffering to me, aswell as others, and was the beginning of trouble which nearly costme my life, a trouble which was not fully recovered from until thefollowing winter. When I was taken with measles in Missouri, thedisease affected my bowels, and they became ulcerated, and all throughthe long spell of typhoid fever and the very slow convalescence thistrouble was very hard to control. When I left Rusk to return to thearmy I was apparently well, but having been comfortably housed allwinter was not in proper condition to enter such a campaign at thisseason of the year. Before leaving winter quarters the men were orderedto prepare ten days2019 rations, and when we overtook the command atFayetteville they had been out nearly that length of time, and rationswere already growing scarce. We furloughed men and a number of recruitswho had accompanied us to join the command were not here to draw orprepare rations, and our only chance for a living was to share rationswith our comrades, who were as liberal and generous as they could be,but they were not able to do much.[Illustration: CAPTAIN D. R. GURLEYSixth Texas Cavalry, A. A. G. Ross2019 Brigade]From the time I overtook the command until we got back to winterquarters was about ten days, and the few days we were in winterquarters were spent in preparing to cross the Mississippi River. Forthe first four or five days I managed to procure, on an average, aboutone biscuit per day; for the other five days we were fortunate to getanything at all to eat, and usually got nothing. We were in the snowfor two days and nights, and in a cold, drenching rain one night. Onthe 7th it was impossible to get a drink of water, to say nothing offood and sleep, and from the time the firing began in the morning untilthe next morning we could get no water, although we were intenselythirsty. While at winter quarters I had a chill, and started down gradein health, a decline in physical condition that continued until I wasapparently nearly dead.In December parts of our cavalry regiments went with Colonel JamesMcIntosh into the Indian Territory to suppress Hopothlaohola, anex-chief of the Creek nation, who, with a considerable band ofdisaffected followers, was making trouble, and part of the Third Texaswent on this expedition. They had a battle with the Indians in themountains on the headwaters of Chustenala Creek, defeated and scatteredthe warriors, captured their squaws, ponies, and negroes, scatteringthem so effectually that we had no further trouble with them.CHAPTER VITHE SIEGE OF CORINTH Leaving Winter Quarters2014The Prairies2014Duvall2019s Bluff2014Awaiting Transportation2014White River2014The Mississippi2014Memphis2014Am Detailed2014En Route to Corinth2014Corinth2014Red Tape2014Siege of Corinth2014201CA Soldier2019s Grave201D2014Digging for Water2014Suffering and Sickness2014Regiment Reorganized2014Evacuation of Corinth.CAPTAIN FRANK M. TAYLOR having died, First Lieutenant J. J. A. Barkerwas promoted to captain and Private James E. Dillard was promoted tosecond lieutenant. After remaining at our winter quarters for a fewdays, resting and feeding up, we started on our long eastward journey,leaving the wounded and sick in charge of Dr. I. K. Frazer. We moveddown on the north side of the Arkansas River, stopping two or threedays opposite Little Rock. During our stay here I availed myself ofthe opportunity of seeing the capital of the State. From Little Rockwe crossed the country to Duvall2019s Bluff on White River, where the menwere requested to dismount, send their horses back to Texas, and goafoot for a time. This they agreed to without a murmur, on the promisethat, at a proper time, we should be remounted.On this march from Arkansas River to White River we crossed grandprairie, and, though I had often heard of these great stretches of deadlevel country, had never seen them. I do not know the distance thatwe marched in this grand prairie, but it was a good many miles, as weentered it early in the morning one day and had to camp in it thatnight, and for almost the whole distance water stood on the ground tothe depth of about two or three inches, and it was a difficult matterto find dry ground enough to camp on at night.Men having been detailed to take our horses back to Texas, the animalswere prepared for the journey, each detailed man having to manage anumber of horses; and to do this they tied the reins of one horse tothe tail of another, each man riding one horse and guiding the leaderof the others, strung out in pairs behind him. As they were recrossingthe grand prairie the buffalo-gnats attacked the horses, stampedingthem and scattering them for many miles over the country, and were withmuch difficulty recaptured.We waited several days at Duvall2019s Bluff for transportation to Memphis,Tenn., on our way to Corinth, Miss. General Joseph L. Hogg, who hadbeen commissioned brigadier-general, accompanied by his staff, cameto us here, with orders to take command of a brigade, including theThird Texas Cavalry at Memphis. General Hogg2019s staff was composed ofcivilians who had never seen service in the army, and this proved tobe an unfortunate time of the year for men not inured to camp lifeto go into active service. His staff consisted of William T. Long,quartermaster; Daniel P. Irby, commissary; H. H. Rogers, of Jefferson,usually called General Rogers, ordnance officer; in addition there wereE. C. Williams, John T. Decherd, and H. S, Newland.After several days2019 waiting a steamboat came up the river, landing atthe Bluff, and we were crowded upon it for our journey down White Riverinto the Mississippi and up to Memphis, and it was hard to realizethat the booming, navigable river we were now on was the same streamwe had forded so many times in the mountains of northern Arkansas onthe night we went in search of our lost artillery. When we got on theMississippi we found it very high, numbers of houses along the banksbeing surrounded by water up to the front doorsteps, where numeroussmall skiffs could be seen moored. These skiffs furnished the residentstheir only means of going from house to house.Arriving at Memphis, we marched away up Poplar Street to the suburbs,and camped in a grove, where we remained several days, spending thetime in preparation for the move to Corinth, Miss. Here General Hoggtook formal command of his brigade, and, having told me that he wantedTom Johnson and myself at his headquarters, he had us detailed,2014Tom tothe ordnance department and me in the quartermaster2019s department, whileJohn A. Boyd was detailed to work in the commissary department.Word having finally come for us to proceed to Corinth, we were crowdedinto a train on the Memphis & Charleston Railroad, en route to thatcity. On this train, as conductor, I found my former friend andschoolmate, William Wingo. The trip to Corinth was a very slow andtedious one, the train being loaded down with troops and supplies, andunfortunately had lost so much time it had to be run very carefullyand make numerous stops. In consequence of this, some of ourover-suspicious 201Cpatriots201D went to General Hogg and implied that theenemy had forces but a short distance north of us and that the slowrunning and the many stoppages of the train was done evidently throughtreachery, and that the plan apparently was to give the enemy anopportunity to capture the train with the men and munitions on board.I had been riding on a rear platform, conversing with Mr. Wingo, when Iproceeded to General Hogg2019s coach, and found him considerably excited.In answer to my inquiry he told me what had been intimated and saidthe suggestion, he thought, was a plausible one, and that he had aboutdetermined to order the train forward at all hazards. He was rather anirritable man, and his suspicions were easily aroused. I endeavoredto quiet him, and did so for a time, by explaining the situation, andpointed out the danger we would be in of colliding with some othertrain unless the utmost caution was used, as was being done; andfinally told him that I had known the conductor since he was a smallboy, had gone to school with him, and was sure there was no treacheryin him. It was not a great while, however, before others came aroundwith similar evil suspicions, until the general was wrought up to sucha pitch that he peremptorily ordered the train run through to Corinth,regardless of consequences, else some dire calamity would overtakeevery person in charge of it. Well, we made the rest of the journeyin very good time, at the risk of many lives, but fortunately withoutaccident. For this our friend and new brigadier-general was on the nextday ordered under arrest by General Beauregard. But nothing more evercame of it.After dragging along for more than thirty hours over a distanceordinarily made in six or seven, we finally disembarked, in the middleof the night, on the north side of the railroad, about two mileswest of Corinth. So here we were, without horses, to confront newconditions, under new commanders, constrained to learn the art of warin a different arm of the service, and to drill, to march, and fight asinfantry.The next morning after our arrival I mounted the quartermaster2019s horse,and rode into town, which was my duty as the quartermaster2019s right-handman, to procure forage for our stock2014that is, for the regimental andbrigade headquarters horses, artillery horses and the wagon teams. Ifound the road leading from our camp to town almost impassable owing tothe mud, impassable even for a good horse and rider, and utterly andabsolutely impassable for a wagon at all, as the best team we had couldnot have drawn an empty wagon over the road.I found Corinth all aglitter with brass buttons and gold lace, thebeautiful Confederate uniform being much in evidence everywhere. Inever had seen anything like it before.The Battle of Shiloh had been fought while we were on the steamerbetween Duvall2019s Bluff and Memphis, General Albert Sidney Johnston hadbeen killed, and the army under General Beauregard had fallen back toCorinth, and the town was literally alive with officers and soldiers.There were more headquarters, more sentinels, and more red tape herethan I had ever dreamed of. I had not seen uniformed officers or menwest of the Mississippi River, and had known nothing of red tape inthe army. Knowing nothing of the organization of the army beyond ourown brigade, I had everything to learn in reference to the properquartermaster, forage master, and master of transportation, as I mustneeds have railroad transportation for my forage.So beginning at the top, I made my way to General Beauregard2019sheadquarters; from there I was directed to division headquarters;thence to a quartermaster; and from one quartermaster to another,until I had about done the town2014and finally found the right man. Onelesson learned not to be gone over. Finding there was no difficulty ingetting forage delivered in Corinth, I had now to hunt up the masterof transportation and satisfy him of the impossibility of haulingit on wagons. Owing to the immense business just then crowding therailroad and the scarcity of rolling stock, it was really a difficultmatter to get the transportation; but by dint of perseverance in thebest persuasive efforts I could bring to bear, I succeeded in havingone day2019s rations sent out by rail. The next day the same thing as totransportation had to be gone over, and the next, and the next, andeach succeeding day it became more difficult to accomplish, until a daycame when it was impossible to get the forage hauled out at all.I rode back to camp and notified the battery and the differentheadquarters that I would issue forage in Corinth, which would have tobe brought out on horseback. All accepted the situation cheerfullyexcept Rogers, who didn2019t seem to like me, and I suppose it was becauseI called him _Mr._ Rogers, instead of General Rogers, as others did.He went directly to General Hogg and said: 201CI think that fellow Barronshould be required to have the forage hauled out.201D General Hogg said:201CI do not think you should say a word, sir; you have been trying for aweek to get a carload of ammunition brought out and have failed. Thisis the first day Barron has failed to get the forage brought out; ifyou want your horses to have corn, send your servant in after it.201D Ihad no further trouble with Mr. Rogers.I cannot remember exactly the time we spent at Corinth. It was fromthe time of our landing there until about the 29th day of May, say sixor seven weeks; but to measure time by the suffering and indescribablehorrors of that never-to-be-forgotten siege, it would seem not lessthan six or seven months. From the effects of malaria, bad water, andother combinations of disease-producing causes, our friends from homesoon began to fall sick, and, becoming discouraged, the staff officersbegan to resign and leave the service. Rogers, I believe, was the firstto go. He was soon followed by the quartermaster and commissary, andsoon all the gentlemen named as coming to the front with General Hoggwere gone, except John T. Decherd, who had been made quartermasterin place of William T. Long, resigned. I bought Long2019s horse andrigging, and Decherd and myself continued to run that department fora time, and Tom Johnson was made ordnance officer in place of Rogers,resigned. General Hogg, being stricken down with disease, was removedto the house of a citizen two or three miles in the country, where hewas nursed by his faithful servant Bob, General W. L. Cabell meantimebeing placed in command of the brigade. General Hogg died a few dayslater2014on the day of the battle of Farmington.The following 201Cpathetic story of Civil War times201D having been publishedin the Nashville (Tenn.) _Banner_, _Youth2019s Companion_, Jacksonville(Tex.) _Reformer_, and perhaps many other papers, I insert it here inorder to give its correction a sort of permanent standing:A SOLDIER2019S GRAVE A pathetic story of Civil War times is related to the older people of Chester County in the western part of Tennessee by the recent death of ex-Governor James S. Hogg of Texas. Some days after the battle of Shiloh, one of the decisive and bloody engagements of the war, fought on April 6-7, 1862, a lone and wounded Confederate soldier made his way to a log cabin located in the woods four miles west of Corinth, Miss., and begged for shelter and food. The man was weak from hunger and loss of blood, and had evidently been wandering through the woods of the sparsely settled section for several days after the battle. The occupants of the cottage had little to give, but divided this little with the soldier. They took the man in and administered to his wants as best they could with their limited resources. They were unable to secure medical attention, and the soldier, already emaciated from the lack of food and proper attention, gradually grew weaker and weaker until he died. Realizing his approaching end, the soldier requested that his body be buried in the wood near the house, and marked with a simple slab bearing his name, 201CGeneral J. L. Hogg, Rusk, Texas.201D The request was complied with, and in the years that passed the family which had so nobly cared for this stranger moved away, the grave became overgrown with wild weeds, and all that was left to mark the soldier2019s resting-place was the rough slab. This rotted by degrees, but was reverently replaced by some passer-by, and in this way the grave was kept marked; but it is doubtful if the few people who chanced to pass that way and see the slab ever gave a thought to the identity of the occupant of the grave, until after the election of Hon. James S. Hogg to the governorship of the State of Texas. Then someone of Chester County who had seen the grave wrote Governor Hogg concerning the dead soldier. In a short time a letter was received, stating that the soldier was Governor Hogg2019s father, and that he entered the Confederate army when the war first broke out, and had never been heard of by relatives or friends. After more correspondence Governor Hogg caused the grave to be enclosed by a neat iron fence, and erected a handsome plain marble shaft over the grave. This monument bears the same simple inscription which marked the rough slab which had stood over the grave of one of the South2019s heroic dead. Conceding the truth of the statement that General J. L. Hogg, of Rusk, Texas, died at a private house four miles west of Corinth, Miss., in the spring of 1862, was buried near by, and that his grave has been properly marked by his son, ex-Governor James S. Hogg, not a word of truth remains in the story, the remainder being fiction pure and simple, and the same may be refuted by a simple relation of the facts and circumstances of General Hogg2019s brief service in the Confederate army and his untimely death2014facts that may easily be verified by the most creditable witnesses. Joseph L. Hogg was appointed brigadier-general by the Confederate War Department in February, 1862. When his commission came he was ordered to report for duty at Memphis, Tenn., where he would be assigned to the command of a brigade of Texas troops. After the battle of Elkhorn a number of Texas regiments were ordered to cross the Mississippi River, among them the Third and Tenth Texas Cavalry2014Company C of the Third and Company I of the Tenth were made up at Rusk. General Hogg2019s oldest son, Thomas E. Hogg, was a private in Company C, and these two regiments formed part of the brigade. General Hogg met the Third Texas at Duvall2019s Bluff on White River, where we dismounted, sent horses home, and went by steamer to Memphis, accompanied by General Hogg. (The battle of Shiloh was fought while we were on this trip.) After the delay incident to the formation of the brigade, getting up necessary supplies, etc., we were transported by rail, in command of General Hogg, to Corinth, or rather we were dumped off on the side of the railroad some two or three miles west of that town. Here General Hogg remained in command of his brigade until he was taken sick and removed by the assistance of our very efficient surgeon, Dr. Wallace McDugald, attended by his negro body servant, Bob 20142014, than whom a more devoted, a more faithful and trustworthy slave never belonged to any man. General Hogg was taken to a private house some two miles west of our camp, where he had every necessary attention until his death. The faithful Bob was with him all the time. Dr. McDugald turned his other sick over to young Dr. Frazer, his assistant, and spent the most of his time with the General,2014was with him when he died,2014giving to him during his illness every medical care known to the science of his profession. Thomas E. Hogg also was frequently with his father2014was there when he passed away. I visited General Hogg only once during his illness, some two or three days before his death. I was kept very busy during this time, and owing to a change in our camps I had to ride six or seven miles to see him, and only found one opportunity of doing so. I found him as comfortably situated as could be expected for a soldier away from home, and receiving every necessary attention. I will state that General Hogg came to us neatly dressed in citizen2019s clothes2014never having had an opportunity of procuring his uniform, so that in fact he never wore the Confederate gray. He was not wounded, was not under fire of the enemy; neither was his brigade, until the battle of Farmington, which occurred the day that General Hogg died. After his death and after the army was reorganized, 201Cfor three years or during the war,201D Dr. McDugald,2014who afterwards married General Hogg2019s daughter,2014Dr. I. K. Frazer, Thomas J. Johnson, one of the General2019s staff, Thomas E. Hogg, and the ever-faithful Bob all came home, and of course related minutely to the widow, the two daughters, and the three minor boys, John Lewis, and James Stephen, all the circumstances of the sickness, the lamented death and burial of the husband and father, Brigadier-General Joseph Louis Hogg.Our camp was moved to a point about three miles east of Corinth.Decherd, the quartermaster, resigned and W. F. Rapley was appointedquartermaster by General Cabell. The rate at which our men fell sickwas remarkable, as well as appalling, and distressing in the extreme.The water we had to drink was bad, very bad, and the rations none ofthe best. The former we procured by digging for it; the earth aroundCorinth being very light and porous, holding water like a sponge.When we first went there the ground was full of water, and by digginga hole two feet deep we could dip up plenty of a mean, milky-lookingfluid; but as the season advanced the water sank, so we dug deeper, andcontinued to go down, until by the latter part of May our water holeswere from eight to twelve feet deep, still affording the same miserablewater. My horse would not drink a drop of the water the men had to use,and if I failed to ride him to a small running branch some two milesaway he would go without drinking. The rations consisted mainly offlour, made into poor camp biscuit, and the most unpalatable pickledbeef.As fared General Hogg and his staff, so fared all the new troops whosaw their first service at Corinth. While many of the old troops weretaken sick, it was much worse with the new. We had one or two new Texasregiments come into our brigade, whose first morning report showed 1200men able for duty; two weeks from that day they could not muster morethan 200 men able to carry a musket to the front. The sick men wereshipped in carload lots down the Mobile & Ohio Railroad, some dying onthe trains, and hundreds of others succumbing at the different townsand stations where they were put off along down that road south ofCorinth. It seemed impossible for the surgeons and their assistantsproperly to care for the number of sick on their hands. Day after dayas I passed the Mobile & Ohio depot, I saw scores of the poor sickfellows on the platform waiting to be hauled off. On the day we leftCorinth I passed Booneville, a station ten miles below Corinth, andhere were perhaps fifty sick men lying in the shade of the trees andbushes. One of the attendants with whom I was acquainted told me he hadjust returned from a tramp of two or three miles, after water for awounded man. At every house he came to the well buckets had been takenoff and hid, and he finally had to fill his canteen with brackish pondwater. Why these sick men had been put off here in the woods, when thestation was the only house in sight, where they could not even get adrink of water, I do not know. The mere recollection of those scenescauses a shudder to this day. I was told that two dead men were lyingon the platform at Booneville, and a Federal scouting party burned thestation during the day. If it was true, they were cremated.As for myself, I was sick, but was on duty all the time. I performedall the active duties of the brigade quartermaster, being compelledto go to Corinth and back from one to three times daily, lookingafter forage and other supplies; carried all orders and instructionsto the regimental quartermasters; superintended the moving of thetrains whenever and wherever they had to be moved; and, in fact, almostlived in my saddle. But, with the exception of two or three nightsspent with the troops at the front, when the day2019s duties were over, Iwas comfortably situated at headquarters, having a good wall tent, acot, and camp-stool, and was kindly treated by General Cabell and themembers of his staff. Dr. S. J. Lewis of Rusk was our brigade surgeon,and did everything he could for my comfort and, had I been well, myposition would have been as pleasant as I could have desired in thearmy, as my duties mainly involved active horseback exercise, whilemy personal surroundings were very agreeable. Nevertheless, I lost myappetite so completely that I was unable to eat any of the rations thatwere issued to the army. I could no more eat one of our biscuits than Icould have eaten a stone, and as for the beef, I could as easily haveswallowed a piece of skunk. The mere sight of it was nauseating. Had Inot been at headquarters doubtless I would have starved to death, sincethere we were able to get a ham or something else extra occasionally,and I managed to eat, but barely enough to keep soul and body together.Dr. Lewis saw me wasting away from day to day, and advised me to takea discharge2014and quit the service; but this I declined to do. I paidGeneral Hogg a short visit one afternoon during his illness, andanother afternoon I rode over to Colonel Bedford Forrest2019s camp, tosee my brother and some other Huntsville, Ala., friends. I found thatmy brother had gone, on sick leave, with Wallace Drake, one of hiscomrades, to some of Drake2019s relatives, down the railroad. With theseexceptions I was not away from my post at any time. I must have gainedsome reputation for efficiency, as the quartermaster of our Arkansasregiment offered to give me half his salary if I would assist him inhis office.All the time we were at Corinth Major-General Halleck, with a largearmy, was moving forward from Pittsburgh Landing, on the TennesseeRiver, near the Shiloh battlefield, by regular approaches. That is, hewould construct line after line of intrenchments, each successive linebeing a little nearer to us. Hence our troops were often turned outand marched rapidly to the front, in expectation of a pitched battlethat was never fought, sometimes being out twenty-four hours. On oneoccasion an active movement was made to Farmington in an effort to cutoff a division of the enemy that had ventured across Hatchie River,and the move was so nearly successful that the enemy, to escape, hadto abandon all their camp equipage. On one of the days when our troopswere rushing to the front in expectation of a battle, I came up with anold patriot marching along through the heat and dust under an umbrella,while a stout negro boy walking by his side carried his gun. This wasthe only man I saw during the war that carried an umbrella to fightunder. As the battle failed to come off that day, I had no opportunityof learning how he would have manipulated the umbrella and gun in anengagement.After General Hogg2019s death and the promotion of Colonel Louis Hebertto brigadier-general, the Third Texas was transferred to Hebert2019sbrigade, and I was temporarily separated from it. On May 8 our year2019senlistment having expired, the men re-enlisted for three years, orduring the war, and the regiment was reorganized by the election ofregimental and company officers, when all the commissioned officersnot promoted in some way returned to Texas. Captain Robert H. Cumby,of Henderson, was elected colonel, Captain H. P. Mabry, of Jefferson,lieutenant-colonel, and our Captain J. J. A. Barker, major. James A.Jones was elected captain of Company C, John Germany, first lieutenant,William H. Carr and R. L. Hood, second lieutenants. I was not presentat the election. Dr. Dan Shaw, of Rusk County, was made surgeon of theregiment.Finally, on May 28, we received orders to strike tents and have thetrains ready to move. General Cabell came to my tent and advised me togo to the hospital, but I insisted that I could make it away from thereon horseback. The next morning the trains were ordered out. Dr. Lewis,having procured about eight ounces of whisky for me, I mounted my horseand followed, resting frequently, and using the stimulant. About noon Ibought a glass of buttermilk and a small piece of corn bread, for whichI paid one dollar. This I enjoyed more than all the food I had tastedfor several weeks.On the day of the evacuation of Corinth, May 29, the Third Texas,being on outpost, was attacked by the enemy in force, and had quitea sharp battle with them in a dense thicket of black jack brush,but charged and gallantly repulsed them. Our new colonel andlieutenant-colonel not being able for service, Major Barker had askedour old Lieutenant-Colonel Lane to remain with us for the time, so theregiment was commanded by him and Major Barker. The regiment sustainedconsiderable loss in this affair, in killed and wounded. Among thekilled was my friend, the gallant young Major J. J. A. Barker; ourorderly sergeant, Wallace Caldwell, was mortally wounded, and JohnLambert disabled, so that he was never fit for service again. For thegallant conduct of the regiment on this occasion, General Beauregardissued a special order complimenting the Third Texas, and speciallydesignating a young man by the name of Smith, from Rusk County. Smithin the charge through the brush found himself with an empty gunconfronting a Federal with loaded musket a few feet from him. TheFederal threw his gun down on him and ordered him to surrender. Smithtold him he would see him in Hades first, and turned to move off whenthe fellow fired, missed his body, but cut one of his arms off abovethe elbow, with a buck and ball cartridge. This was the kind of pluckthat General Beauregard admired.[1] On that day the entire army waswithdrawn and moved out from Corinth and vicinity. The manner andcomplete success of this movement of General Beauregard2019s has been veryhighly complimented by military critics.CHAPTER VIIBATTLE OF IUKA Camp at Tupelo, Miss.2014Furloughed2014Report for Duty2014Camp Routine2014201CThe Sick Call201D2014Saltillo2014Personnel of the Brigade2014Baldwin2014201CContraband201D2014On to Iuka2014Iuka2014Battle of Iuka2014Casualties2014Retreat.IN the early days of June our command halted and went into campnear Tupelo, Miss., where it remained for several weeks. Here, as Iwas physically unfit for service, I voluntarily abandoned my placeat General Cabell2019s headquarters and returned to my own regiment.Obtaining, without difficulty, a thirty days2019 furlough, I called on Dr.Shaw for medicine, but he informed me that he had nothing but opium,which would do me no good. But he added, 201CYou need a tonic; if youcould only get some whisky, that would soon set you up.201D Mounting myhorse I went down into Pontotoc County, and, finding a good-lookingfarmhouse away from the public roads, I engaged board with Mr. Dunn,the proprietor, for myself and horse for thirty days. Mr. Dunn told meof a distillery away down somewhere below the town of Pontotoc, andfinding a convalescent in the neighborhood I sent him on my horse tolook for it, with the result that he brought me back four canteens of201Ctonic.201DNow Mr. Dunn2019s family consisted of that clever elderly gentleman, hiswife, and a handsome, intelligent daughter, presumably about twentyyears of age. I soon realized that I had been very fortunate in theselection of a boarding house and that my lot for the next thirtydays had been cast in a pleasant place, for every necessary attentionwas cheerfully shown me by each member of the family. They had losta son and brother, who had wasted away with consumption, and in mydilapidated and emaciated condition they said I favored him, so theywere constantly reminded of a loved one who had gone to his grave inabout the same manner I seemed to be going, and they felt almost as ifthey were ministering to the wants of one of the family. They lived ina comfortable house, and everything I saw indicated a happy, well-to-dofamily. Their table, spread three times a day, was all that could bedesired. We had corn bread, fresh milk and butter, fresh eggs, lastyear2019s yam potatoes, a plentiful supply of garden vegetables and othergood things, everything brought on the table being well prepared. Atfirst I had little or no appetite, but thanks to Miss Dunn2019s treatment,it soon began to improve. She, using the 201Ctonic,201D gave me an egg-nogjust before each meal, and, blackberries being plentiful, she gave meblackberries in every form, including pies and cordial, all of which,for one in my condition, was the best possible treatment.So I improved and gained strength, not rapidly, but steadily, andthough the thirty days was not as much time as I needed for a completeconvalescence, it was all I had asked for. Mr. Dunn manifested a greatdeal of interest in my welfare; he did not think I could recover myhealth in the service, and urged me most earnestly to go back to camp,get a discharge, and go to Cooper2019s Well, a health resort down inMississippi, and I was almost compelled to promise him I would do so,when in truth I had no such intention. The thirty days having expired,I bade farewell to these good people who had taken in a stranger and sokindly cared for him, and returned to camp, not strong or well by anymeans, but improved, especially in the matter of an appetite.Going up to regimental headquarters upon my return to the command I letout my horse for his board, procured a rifle and at once reported toour company commander for duty. The strictest military discipline wasmaintained by General Louis Hebert in every particular, and one day2019sduty was very much like the duties of every other day, with a variationfor Sunday. Of course the same men did not have the same duties toperform every day, as guard duty and fatigue duty were regulated bydetails made from the alphabetical rolls of the companies, but thesame round of duties came every day in the week. At reveille we mustpromptly rise, dress, and hurry out into line for roll call; thenbreakfast. After breakfast guard-mounting for the ensuing twenty-fourhours, these guards walking their posts day and night, two hours on andfour hours off. Before noon there were two hours2019 drill for all men noton guard or some other special duty; then dinner. In the afternoon itwas clean up camps, clean guns, dress parade at sundown; then supper,to bed at taps. On Sunday no drill, but, instead, we had to go out fora review, which was worse, as the men had to don all their armor, theofficers button up their uniforms to the chin, buckle on their swords,and all march about two miles away through the dust and heat to an oldfield, march around a circle at least a mile in circumference, and backto camps. All that, including the halting and waiting, usually took upthe time until about noon.With the understanding and agreement that I would be excused from thedrill ground when I broke down, and when on guard be allowed to restwhen I had walked my post as long as I could, I went on duty as awell man. For quite a while I was compelled to leave the drill groundbefore the expiration of the two hours, and when I found I could notwalk my post through the two hours some one of my comrades usually tookmy place. It was necessary for me to muster all my courage to do thiskind of soldiering, but the exertion demanded of me and the exerciseso improved my condition that soon I no longer had to be excused fromany part of my duties. We had men in the command afflicted with chronicdiarrhea who, yielding to the enervating influence of the disease,would lie down and die, and that was what I determined to avoid if Icould.Among other bugle calls we had 201Cthe sick call.201D Soon after breakfastevery morning this, the most doleful of all the calls, was sounded,when the sick would march up and line themselves in front of thesurgeon2019s tent for medical advice and treatment. Our surgeon, Dr. DanShaw, was a character worthy of being affectionately remembered by allthe members of the Third Texas Cavalry. He was a fine physician, andI had fallen in love with him while he was a private soldier becausehe so generously ex-erted his best skill in assisting Dr. McDugald tosave my life at Carthage, Mo. He was a plain, unassuming, jolly oldfellow, brave, patriotic, and full of good impulses. He was the man whoindignantly declined an appointment as surgeon soon after the battle ofOak Hills, preferring to remain a private in 201CCompany B, Greer2019s Texasregiment,201D to being surgeon of an Arkansas regiment.Knowing that he had no medicine except opium, I would go up somemornings, through curiosity, to hear his prescriptions for the variousailments that he had to encounter. He would walk out with an oldjackknife in his hand, and conveniently located just behind him couldbe seen a lump of opium as big as a cannonball. Beginning at the headof the line he would say to the first one: 201CWell, sir, what is thematter with _you_?201D 201CI don2019t know, doctor; I2019ve got a pain in my back,a hurting in my stomach, or a misery in my head, or I had a chill lastnight.201D 201CLet me see your tongue. How2019s your bowels?201D He would thenturn around and vigorously attack the lump of opium with his knife,and roll out from two to four pills to the man, remarking to each ofhis waiting patients: 201CThere, take one of these every two hours.201D Thushe would go, down the line to the end, and in it all there was littlevariation2014none to speak of except in the answers of the individuals,the number of pills, or the manner of taking. And what else could hedo? He had told me frankly that he had nothing in his tent that woulddo me any good, but these men had to have medicine.For water at Tupelo we dug wells, each company a well, using a sweepto draw it. In this hilly portion of the State good water could beobtained by digging from twenty to twenty-five feet.[Illustration: FRANK M. TAYLORFirst Captain of Company C, Third Texas Cavalry]From the time of the reorganization at Corinth up to the middle of JulyCompany C had lost a number of men. Some, as McDugald and Dillard, werecommissioned officers, and did not re-enlist; some were discharged onapplications, and others under the conscription law then in force,a law exempting all men under eighteen and over forty-five years ofage. Among those discharged I remember the two Ackers, Croft, I. K.Frazer, Tom Hogg, Tom Johnson, W. A. Newton, William Pennington,and R. G. Thompson, all of whom returned to Texas except WilliamPennington, who remained with us a considerable time, notwithstandinghis discharge. In the regimental officers several changes had beenmade. After the death of Major Barker, Captain Jiles S. Boggess, ofCompany B, from Henderson, was promoted to major; Colonel R. H. Cumbyresigned, and Lieutenant-Colonel Mabry was made colonel. J. S. Boggess,Lieutenant-Colonel, and Captain A. B. Stone, of Company A, fromMarshall, promoted to major. About the first of August we moved up therailroad to Saltillo, about fifteen miles north of Tupelo, establishedcamps, dug wells, and remained about three weeks. Here the Fortieth (?)or Mississippi regiment joined the brigade. This was a new regiment,just out from home, and it seemed to us, from the amount of luggagethey had, that they had brought about all their household goods along.This regiment is remembered for these distinct peculiarities. Asidefrom the weight and bulk of its baggage they had the tallest man andthe largest boy in the army, and the colonel used a camel to carryhis private baggage. The tall man was rather slender, and looked to beseven feet high; the boy was sixteen or eighteen years old, and weighedmore than three hundred pounds.The brigade now consisted of the Third Texas, Whitfield2019s Texas Legion,the Third Louisiana, the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Arkansas, and theFortieth Mississippi.[2] The army here, commanded by General Price, wascomposed of two divisions commanded by Generals Little and D. H. Maury.Many of the troops that came out of Corinth with General Beauregard hadgone with General Bragg into Kentucky. At the end of three weeks wemoved farther up the railroad to Baldwin. Here we dug more wells, andit was my fortune to be on the second day2019s detail that dug our companywell. The first detail went down some eight feet, about as deep as theycould throw the earth out. The next morning four of us, including C. C.Watkins and myself, the two weakest men, physically, in the company,were detailed to continue the digging. We arranged means for drawingthe earth out, and began work, two at the time, one to dig and one todraw. At quitting time in the evening we had it down twenty-one feet,and had plenty of water. But we were not to remain long at Baldwin, aspreparations for moving on Iuka were soon begun. As commissary supplieswere gathered in for the approaching campaign they were stored in thefreight department of the depot. One R. M. Tevis, of Galveston, wasacting as commissary of subsistence, and Charlie Dunn, of Shreveport,was his assistant. They occupied a small room, the station agent2019soffice, in the building during the day. A good many fatigue men wereusually about the place during the day, to handle the stuff that wasbrought in.One day, while I was on the platform, a country wagon drove up.Tevis and Dunn seemed to have expected its arrival, as they weresoon out looking after the unloading. Among the rest was a barrel, awell-hooped, forty-gallon barrel, and instead of being sent in withthe other stores it was hurriedly rolled into the private office ofthe commissary. This proved to be a barrel of peach brandy. Now, peachbrandy was 201Ccontraband.201D The character and contents of the barrelwere shrewdly guessed by the bystanders as it was hurried into itshiding-place, and its locality, after it had been stowed away, wasclearly observed and mental note made thereof. The depot building waslocated at the north end of a cut and was elevated fully three feetabove the ground, platforms and all. The Third Texas was camped alongon the east side of the cut, say one hundred yards below the depot. Thesupplies were guarded day and night, the guards walking their beats,around on the platform. The next morning the guards were seen pacingthe beats all right enough, but in the bottom of that barrel was anauger hole, and there was an auger hole through the depot floor, butthere was not a gill of brandy in the barrel. At dress parade thatmorning it was unnecessary to call in an expert to determine that thebrandy, when it leaked out, had come down the railroad cut. The twogentlemen most vitally interested in this occurrence dared not makecomplaint, but bore their sad bereavement in profound silence, and noone else ever mentioned it.This brief stay at Baldwin terminated our summer vacation and our studyof Hardie2019s infantry tactics. The constant all-summer drilling and thestrict discipline we had been subjected to had rendered our dismountedcavalry the most efficient troops in the army, as they were good ineither infantry or cavalry service, as was afterwards abundantly proved.All things being ready, the march to Iuka was begun under GeneralPrice, with his two divisions. Up to this time the only infantrymarching I had done, beyond drilling and reviews, was the two moves,Tupelo to Sattillo and Sattillo to Baldwin. As we were furnishedtransportation for cooking utensils only, the men had to carry alltheir worldly effects themselves and the knapsack must contain allclothing, combs, brushes, writing material and all else the soldierhad or wished to carry, in addition to his gun, his cartridge box withforty rounds of ammunition, his cap box, haversack, and canteen. Theweather was extremely hot, and the roads dry and fearfully dusty. WhileI had been on full duty for some time I was very lean, physically weak,and far from being well, and starting out to make a march of severaldays, loaded down as I was, I had some misgivings as to my ability tomake it; but I did not hesitate to try. As the object of the expeditionwas to move on Iuka and capture the force there before General Grantcould reinforce them from Corinth, a few miles west of that place, thetroops were moved rapidly as practicable, the trains being left behindto follow on at their leisure. Unfortunately for me, I was on guardduty the last night before reaching our destination, and as we moved onsoon after midnight I got no sleep.Next morning after daylight, being within six or seven miles of Iuka,the Third Texas and Third Louisiana were placed in front, with ordersto march at quick time into Iuka. Now, literally, this means thirtyinches at a step and 116 steps per minute; practically it meant for usto get over that piece of road as rapidly as our tired legs could carryus. To keep up with this march was the supreme effort of the expeditionon my part. I do not think I could have kept up if Lieutenant Germanyhad not relieved me of my gun for three or four miles of the distance.We found the town clear of troops, but had come so near surprising themthat they had to abandon all their commissary stores, as they did nothave time to either remove or destroy them. At the end of the march mystrength was exhausted, and my vitality nearly so. The excitement beingat an end, I collapsed, as it were, and as soon as we went into camp Ifell down on the ground in the shade of a tree where I slept in a kindof stupor until nearly midnight.We remained about a week in and around Iuka, in line of battle nearlyall the time, expecting an attack by forces from Corinth; and as it wasuncertain by which one of three roads they would come, we were hurriedout on first one road and then another. One afternoon we were hurriedlymoved out a mile or two on what proved to be a false alarm, and wereallowed to return to camps. On returning we found a poor soldier lyingin our company camp with a fearful hole in his head, where a buck andball cartridge had gone through it. A musket was lying near him, andwe could only suppose he was behind in starting on the march, and hadkilled himself accidentally.On the night of September 18 we marched out about four miles on theCorinth road, leading west, and lay in line of battle until about4 P. M. the next day, when a courier came in great haste, with theinformation that the enemy was advancing on the Bay Springs road fromthe south, with only a company of our cavalry in front of them. Wehad then to double quick back about three miles in order to get intothe road they were on. We found them among the hills about one and ahalf miles from the town, a strong force of infantry, with nine orten pieces of artillery, and occupying a strong position of their ownselection. We formed on another hill in plain view of them, a littlevalley intervening between the two lines. Our fighting force consistedof General Little2019s division of two brigades, Hebert2019s, and a brigadeof Alabama and Mississippi troops commanded by Colonel John D. Martin,and the Clark battery of four guns, Hebert2019s brigade in front of theircenter, with two of Martin2019s regiments on our right and two on ourleft. We began a skirmish fire, and kept it up until our battery wasin position, when we began a rapid fire with canister shot. We thenadvanced in double line of battle, slowly at first, down the hill onwhich we had formed, across the little valley and began the ascent ofthe hill on which the enemy was posted, General W. S. Rosecrans incommand. As we ascended the hill we came in range of our own artillery,and the guns had to be silenced. The entire Federal artillery fire wassoon turned on us, using grape and canister shot, and as their batterywas directly in front of the Third Texas, their grape shot and musketryfire soon began to play havoc with our people, four of our men, the twofiles just to my right, being killed. We charged the battery, and withdesperate fighting took nine pieces and one caisson. The horses hitchedto the caisson tried to run off, but we shot them down and took it, thebrave defenders standing nobly to their posts until they were nearlyall shot down around their guns,2014one poor fellow being found lyingnear his gun, with his ramrod grasped in both hands, as if he were inthe act of ramming down a cartridge when he was killed. The infantryfought stubbornly, but after we captured their guns we drove them backstep by step, about six hundred yards, when darkness put an end to abattle that had lasted a little more than two and a half hours, thelines being within two hundred yards of each other.I cannot give the number of Federal troops engaged in the battle,but General Rosecrans, in giving his casualties, enumerates eighteenregiments of infantry, three of cavalry, one detached company, andfour batteries of artillery. The cavalry was not in the engagement,and I think he had but two batteries engaged. One of these, theEleventh Ohio Light Battery, lost its guns and fifty-four men. Thetotal Federal loss, reported, was 790, including killed, wounded, andmissing. Hebert2019s brigade, that did the main fighting, was composedof six regiments, reporting 1774 for duty, and lost 63 killed, 305wounded, and 40 missing; total, 408. Colonel Martin had four regiments(1405 men), and lost 22 killed and 95 wounded; total, 117. We had twobatteries with us, the Clark battery and the St. Louis battery, butthey only fired a few shots. The Third Texas had 388 men, and lost 22killed and 74 wounded; total, 96. Company C lost W. P. Bowers, CarterCaldwell, W. P. Crawley, and W. T. Harris killed; and J. J. Felpsseverely wounded. Crawley had a belt of gold around his waist, but onlyfour or five of us knew this, and I presume, of course, it was buriedwith him. General Maury2019s division was not engaged. General HenryLittle, our division commander, was killed. Lieutenant Odell, of theThird Texas, who was acting regimental commissary, and who was mountedon my horse, was killed, and the horse was also killed. Colonels Mabryand Whitfield, and, I believe, all our other colonels were wounded. Thecaptured artillery was drawn by hand into town that night, where theguns were left next morning, after being spiked, as we had no sparehorses to pull them away. Spiking guns means that round steel fileswere driven hard into the touch-holes, giving the enemy the trouble ofdrilling these out before the guns can be of any use again.As General Ord was marching rapidly with a strong force from Corinthto reinforce General Rosecrans, General Price concluded to retreat.Putting the trains in the road some time before daylight, early inthe morning the troops marched out southward, leaving our woundedmen in Iuka and sending a detail back to bury the dead. As GeneralHebert2019s brigade had stood the brunt of the battle the evening before,we were put in front and, to clear the road for the other troops, wehad to move at double quick time for six miles. This used me up, and Iobtained permission to go as I pleased, which enabled me to outgo thecommand and to rest occasionally while they were coming up. We made amarch of twenty-five miles that day on our way back to Baldwin. Butoh, how my feet were blistered! They felt as if I had my shoes filledwith hot embers. Late in the afternoon, when I was away ahead of thecommand I came to Bay Springs. This little village stands on a bluffof a wide, deep creek, and is crossed by a long, high bridge. At thistime, when the creek was low, the bridge was at least twenty-five feetabove the mud and water below. I climbed down under the bluff, justbelow the bridge, to a spring, where I slaked my thirst, bathed myburning feet and sat there resting and watching the wagons cross thebridge. Presently a six-mule team, pulling a wagon heavily loaded withammunition in boxes, was driven onto the bridge, and as it was movingslowly along one of the hind wheels, the right one, ran so close to theedge that the end of the bridge flooring crumbled off and let the wheeldown. Gradually this wheel kept sliding until the other hind wheel wasoff. This let the ammunition go to the bottom of the creek, followed bythe wagon bed. Soon off came one fore wheel. This pulled off the otherone, then the wagon tongue tripped the offwheel mule and he dangled bythe side of the bridge, and soon pulled the saddle mule off, and thisprocess gradually went on, until the last mule started, and as he felloff his hamestring caught on the end of the bridge flooring, and for aninstant the whole outfit of wagon and six mules hung by the hamestring,when it broke and down went the wagon and the six mules atop of it. Thedriver had seen the danger in time to make his escape.We soon arrived at Baldwin, our starting point. Our wounded left atIuka fell into the hands of the enemy and were kindly treated and wellcared for. The good women of the town and surrounding country came totheir rescue nobly, and they received every necessary attention.CHAPTER VIIIBATTLE OF CORINTHCaptain Dunn, the 201CMormon201D2014Paroles2014Baldwin2014On toCorinth2014Conscription2014Looking for Breakfast2014The Army Trapped2014ASkirmish2014Escape2014Holly Springs2014Battle of Corinth2014Casualties2014CavalryAgain.CAPTAIN DUNN, of Company F, was one of our badly wounded men, one ofhis legs having been broken by a grape shot. Captain Dunn was a uniquecharacter. He was a lawyer by profession, a very bright fellow, andlived at Athens, Tex. The first I ever knew of him he came to Rusk justbefore the war, to deliver an address to a Sunday-school convention.He was a very small man. In fact, so diminutive in stature that hewas almost a dwarf. He was a brave, gallant soldier, a companionable,pleasant associate, and much of a wag. He was a great lover of fun, somuch so that he would sacrifice comfort and convenience and risk hisreputation in order to perpetrate a joke.The ladies who came to nurse and care for our wounded soldiers atIuka were like other women in one particular respect, at least,2014theywere desirous to know whether the soldiers were married or single,religious or otherwise, and if religious, their church relationship,denominational preferences and so on, and would converse with the boyswith a view of learning these particulars. The usual questions wereput to Captain Dunn by one of these self-sacrificing attendants. Hemade no effort to deny that he was married and, with some hesitation,frankly acknowledged that he was a member of the church of the LatterDay Saints, usually called Mormons, which was enough informationfor one interview. With the exclamation, 201CWhy, _you_ a Mormon!201D thewoman retired. In whispers she soon imparted to all the other ladieswho visited the hospital the astounding information that one of theTexas soldiers was a Mormon. They were incredulous, but after beingvehemently assured by the interviewer that she had it from his ownlips, some believed it was true, while others believed it was a jokeor a mistake. To settle the question they appointed a committeeof discreet ladies to ascertain the truth of the matter, and thecommittee promptly waited upon Captain Dunn. Without loss of time inpreliminaries, the spokeswoman of the committee said: 201CCaptain Dunn, wehave heard that you are a Mormon and have come to you, as a committee,to learn the truth of the matter. Are you a Mormon?201D 201CYes, madam,201Dsaid Captain Dunn. 201CHave you more than one wife?201D 201CYes,201D said CaptainDunn, 201CI have four wives.201D 201CCaptain Dunn, don2019t you think it awfulwrong? Don2019t you think it2019s monstrous to be a Mormon?201D 201CNo, madam,201Dsaid Dunn, 201Cthat2019s my religion, the religion I was brought up in fromchildhood. All of my regiment are Mormons. All of them that are marriedhave two or more wives. The colonel has six; some have four, and somefive, just as they may feel able to take care of them.201D A meeting ofthe ladies was then called, an indignation meeting, and indignation wasexpressed in unmeasured terms. The very idea! that they had scrapedlint, torn their best garments into bandages, had cooked and broughtsoups and all the delicacies they could prepare to the hospital2014doneall they could, even to the offering up their prayers, for a detestableMormon, with four wives! It was unanimously resolved that it could bedone no longer. From that good hour, in passing through the hospitalministering to the wants of all the other wounded, they gave Dunn noteven as much as a look, to say nothing of smiles, cups of cold water,soups, cakes, pies, and other more substantial comforts.This neglect of Captain Dunn was eventually noticed by the othersoldiers, talked of, and regretted by them and its cause inquired into.They earnestly interceded with the ladies in his behalf, and urgedthem that whatever Captain Dunn2019s faults might be, he was a braveConfederate soldier, and had been severely wounded in an attempt todefend their homes, that he was suffering greatly from his wounds; thatif he was a Mormon he was a human being, and for humanity2019s sake hedeserved some attention and sympathy, and should not be allowed to diethrough neglect. This argument finally prevailed, the resolution wasrescinded, and the captain fared well for the rest of the time, evenbetter than he had before the matter came up.One day one of the ladies asked Captain Dunn how it happened that hegot his leg so badly crushed. In the most serious manner he said toher: 201CWell, madam, I am captain of a company, and when we got into thebattle the Yankees began shooting cannonballs at us, and to protect mymen I got out in front of them and would catch the cannonballs as theycame and throw them back at the Yankees; but when the battle grew realhot they came so fast I couldn2019t catch all of them, and one of thembroke my leg.201DAs soon as our men thought they were able to travel they were paroledand allowed to go free. When Captain Dunn was paroled he went to Texasfor a rest, until he supposed he might be exchanged. On his return,he was traveling through Arkansas when a woman on the train asked himwhere he was going? He replied, 201CMadam, I am going to Richmond in theinterest of the women of Texas. I am going to make an effort to inducethe Confederate congress, in view of the great number of men that arebeing killed in the war, to pass a law providing that every man, afterthe war ends, shall have two wives.201DWhen paroling our people their paroles were filled out by a Federalofficer and presented to them for their signatures. The majority of themen cared little about the form, but only of the fact that they were tobe allowed to go free until they were exchanged. But when they came toColonel Mabry he read the parole over very carefully. He was describedas H. P. Mabry, a colonel in the 201Cso-called Confederate States Army.201DMabry shook his head and said, 201CSir, can you not leave out that2018so-called?2019201D He was informed that it could not be done. 201CThen,201D saidthe colonel, 201CI will not sign it.201D 201CIn that case,201D said the officer,201Cyou will have to go to prison.201D 201CWell,201D Mabry replied, 201CI will go toprison and stay there until I rot before I will sign a parole withthat 2018so-called Confederate States2019 in it.201DCaptain Lee, of the Third Texas, was of the same way of thinking, andthey both went to prison and remained there until they were exchanged,being sent to some prison in Illinois. Some months after they wereexchanged and came back to us we captured some prisoners one day. Oneof them inquired if the Third Texas was there, and was told that itwas. 201CThen,201D said he, 201Ctake me to Colonel Mabry or Captain Lee, andI2019ll be all right.201D This man was a 201Ccopperhead201D whose acquaintance theyhad made while in prison. He didn2019t want to serve in the army againstus, but had been drafted in, and was glad of an opportunity of changinghis uniform.At Baldwin about two days was spent in preparation for a march toRipley, there to join General Van Dorn2019s command for a move on Corinth.I was on fatigue duty while at Baldwin, and had no time to recuperateafter the hard campaign to Iuka and back, having been on guard duty thenight before arriving at Ripley. We camped at that town one night andstarted next morning, September 29, 1862, for Corinth, General Van Dornin command. On that morning I found myself with a fever, and feelingunequal to a regular march I obtained permission to march at will, andfound Lieutenant R. L. Hood and F. M. Dodson in the same condition andhaving a like permit. We joined our forces and moved up the hot, dustyroad about six miles. Being weary, footsore, and sick, we turned intothe woods, lay down and went to sleep under some oak trees and did notwake until the beef cattle were passing us in the afternoon. Thismeant that we had slept until the entire army was ahead of us2014cavalry,infantry, artillery, and wagon train. We moved on until night withoutovertaking our command. Nearing the village of Ruckersville it occurredto me that many years ago this had been the post office of PeterCotten, my mother2019s brother. Stopping at a house to make inquiries, Ilearned that Willis Cook, his son-in-law, lived only three-quarters ofa mile west of the village. We turned in that direction, and soon foundthe place without difficulty. My call at the gate was answered by myuncle at the front door. I recognized his voice, although I had notheard it since I was a small boy. Going into the house I made myselfknown to him and his daughter, Mrs. Crook, and received a cordialwelcome, such a welcome as made me and my comrades feel perfectly athome. My good cousin, Tabitha, whose husband, Willis Crook, was in thecavalry service, and in the army then on its way to Corinth, soon hada splendid supper ready for us and in due time offered us a nice bed.We begged out of occupying the beds, however, and with their permissionstretched our weary limbs under a shade tree in the yard and enjoyed agood night2019s sleep.Next morning one or two of the party had chills, and we rested for theday. We soon learned that a Federal cavalry command had dropped inbehind our army, and so we were cut off. Had we gone on in the morningwe would probably have been captured during the day. Learning how wecould find parallel roads leading in the direction we wished to go,late in the evening we started, traveled a few miles and slept in thewoods. The next morning we moved on until ten o2019clock, and meeting aten-year-old boy on a pony in a lane, we asked him if he knew where wecould get something to eat. He said there was a potato patch right overthere in the field. We asked him to whom it belonged, and he answered:201CIt belongs to my uncle; but he is laying out in the brush to keep outof the army;201D and told us that his uncle lived up on the hill a shortdistance ahead of us. We did not go into the potato patch, but wentup to the uncle2019s house. The house was a fairly good one, and in thefront were two good-sized rooms with a wide, open hall. As we marchedup to the rail fence in front of the house a woman came out into thehall, and we could see that the very looks of us aggravated and annoyedher. By way of getting acquainted with her, Dodson said: 201CMadam,have you got any water?201D In a sharp, cracked voice, she answered: 201CIreckon I have. If I hain2019t, I would be in a mighty bad fix!201D Having itunderstood that Dodson was to do the talking, we marched in and helpedourselves to a drink of water each, from a bucket setting on a shelfin the hall. During the next few minutes silence of the most profoundsort prevailed. We stood there as if waiting to be invited to sit downand rest, but instead of inviting us to seats she stood scowling on usas if she was wishing us in Davy Jones2019 locker or some similar place.Hood and myself finally moved a little towards the front of the hall,and the following dialogue took place between Dodson and the woman:Dodson: 201CMadam, we are soldiers and are tired and hungry. We havebeen marching hard, and last night we slept in the woods and haven2019thad anything to eat. Could we get a little something here?201D 201CNo, youcan2019t. I don2019t feed none of your sort. You are just goin2019 about overthe country eatin2019 up what people2019s got, and a-doin2019 no good.201D 201CWhy,madam, we are fighting for the country.201D 201CYes, you are fightin2019 to keepthe niggers from bein2019 freed, and they2019ve just as much right to be freeas you have.201D 201COh, no, madam; the Bible says they shall be slaves aslong as they live.201D 201CThe Bible don2019t say no sech a thing.201D 201COh, yes, itdoes,201D said Dodson, gently; 201Clet me have your Bible and I2019ll show it toyou.201D 201CI hain2019t got no Bible.201D 201CMadam, where is your husband?201D 201CThat2019snone of your business, sir!201D 201CIs he about the house, madam?201D 201CNo, heain2019t.201D 201CIs he in the army, madam?201D 201CNo, he ain2019t. If you _must_ know,he2019s gone off to keep from bein2019 tuk to Ripley and sold for twenty-fivedollars.201D 201CWhy, madam, is he a nigger?201D 201CNo, he ain2019t a nigger; he2019sjust as white as you air, sir.201D 201CWell, madam, I didn2019t know that theysold white men in Mississippi.201D 201CNo, you don2019t know what your ownpeople2019s a-doin2019.201D During the conversation I kept my eye on the lowestplace in the fence. What she said about being sold for twenty-fivedollars was in allusion to a reward of that amount offered by theconscript authorities for able-bodied men who were hiding in the brushto keep out of the army.That night we lodged with a good old Confederate who treated us thebest he could. Next morning Dodson bought a pony from him, which weused as a pack-horse to carry our luggage. We then moved much easier.Late in the evening we crossed Hatchie River on the bridge over whichthe army had passed on its way to Corinth. Here we found Adam2019s Brigadeand Whitfield2019s Legion guarding the bridge, that it might be used inthe event of the army2019s being compelled to retreat. This bridge wasonly a short distance south of the Memphis & Charleston Railroad, and afew miles west of Corinth. We took the railroad and followed it nearlyall night, turning off to sleep a little while before daylight. Earlyin the morning we struck across into the main-traveled road, and pushedon in an effort to rejoin our command. About nine or ten o2019clock wecame to a house, and determined to try for some breakfast, as we werequite hungry. We afterwards learned that a poor old couple occupied thehouse. Walking up to the front door we asked the old lady if we couldget some breakfast, telling her we had been out all night and werehungry, and so on, the usual talk. She very readily said, yes, if wewould wait until she could prepare it. She then invited us to come inand be seated, and said she would have the meal ready in a few minutes.In a little while she came back and invited us in to breakfast in alittle side room used for a kitchen and dining-room. As we started inI was in front, and as we entered the little dining-room and came insight of the table she began to apologize because she was unable togive us anything more. I glanced at the table and saw a small, thinhoe-cake of corn bread and a few small slices of bacon, 201Conly thisand nothing more.201D I asked her if that was all she had. She answeredthat it was. Then I said, 201CWhere are you going to get more when thatis gone?201D She did not know. Not doubting the truth of her statements,I said: 201CMadam, while we are hungry and do not know when we will getanything to eat, we could not take all you have. While we are just asthankful to you as if you had given us a bountiful breakfast, we aresoldiers, and can manage to get something to eat somewhere, and willleave this for you and your husband,201D and we bade her good-by withoutsitting down to the table or tasting her scanty offering.This poor old woman, who must have been sixty or more years old, hadsaid, without a murmur and without hesitation or excuse, that she wouldprepare us some breakfast, and gone about it as cheerfully as if shehad had an abundance, cooking us all the provisions she had, and onlyregretted she could not do more for us,2014this, too, when not knowingwhere she would get any more for herself.After leaving this humble abode we soon began to meet troops,ambulances, and so on, and from them we learned that our army wasfalling back. Instead of going farther we stopped on the roadside andwaited for our command. Noticing a squad of soldiers out some distancefrom the road engaged apparently about something unusual, my curiosityled me out to where they were. To my surprise I found they were MadisonCounty, Alabama, men, most of whom I knew. They were burying a poorfellow by the name of Murry, whom I had known for years, and who livedout near Maysville. They had rolled him up in his blanket and wereletting him down into a shallow grave when I approached, and they toldme that some of the boys that I knew were wounded2014in a wagon justacross the road. I soon found my old friends, John M. Hunter and PeterBeasley, of Huntsville, Ala., in a common, rough road-wagon. PoorHunter! he was being hauled over the long, rough road only that hemight die among his friends, which he did in a few days. Beasley wasnot dangerously wounded.We soon after joined our command and marched westward toward Hatchiebridge. But long before we got there Generals Ord and Hurlbut hadcome down from Bolivar, Tenn., with a heavy force of fresh troops,had driven our guards away, and were in undisputed possession of thecrossing. Whitfield2019s Legion had been on the west side and had been soclosely crowded, with such a heavy fire concentrated on the bridge,that they had to take to the water to make their escape.Here was a problem confronting General Van Dorn, a problem which mustbe speedily solved, otherwise a dire calamity awaited his whole army.These two divisions of fresh troops were in front of an army of tired,hungry, worn-out Confederates, with General Grant2019s victorious armyonly a few miles in our rear. What was called the boneyard road ransome miles south of us and crossed the river on a bridge at Crum2019sMill; but this bridge, as a precautionary measure, had just beenburned, and even now its framework was still aflame. The route we wereon led west from Corinth parallel with, and but a little south of, theMemphis & Charleston Railroad, crossing Hatchie only a short distancesouth of Pocahontas. After crossing the river we would turn south onthe main Ripley road, and this road ran parallel with the river,passing not far, three or four miles perhaps, west of Crum2019s Mill, sothat a force might move rapidly from Corinth, on the boneyard road,cross at Crum2019s Mill and strike us in the flank and possibly captureour trains. Hence the precaution of burning this bridge. Everything ofour army, whether on wheels, on foot, or on horseback, was now betweenOrd and Hurlbut in front and Grant and Rosecrans in the rear, without acrossing on Hatchie. The trains were parked, with a view, as I was toldat the time, to burning them, leaving the troops to get out as theycould, and we already had visions of swimming the stream. Personally Iwas wondering how much of my luggage I could get over with, and whetheror not I could make it with a dry gun and cartridge box. General Price,in this dilemma, undertook to get the trains out, and he succeedednotably.We had a pretty heavy skirmish with the forces at the bridge, withinfantry and artillery, but only to divert attention from the trainsas they moved out to gain the boneyard road. General Price went to themill and, pulling down the gable end, cast it on the mill dam, andthus made a temporary bridge over which the trains and artillery weredriven. Then that gallant old man, who had just proved himself to beas much at home acting as chief wagon master as when commanding hisarmy corps, sat on his horse at the end of his unique bridge nearlyall night, hurrying the wagons and artillery across. On the west bankof the stream he kept a bonfire alight, which threw a flickering glareacross the bridge. As each teamster drove on to the east end of thequeer bridge he would slow up his team and peer through the dim lightfor the proper and safe route. Just as he would slow up one could hearthe loud, distinct voice of 201COld Pap201D shouting: 201CDrive up there! Driveup! Drive up! Drive up!201D And thus it continued until every wheel hadrolled across to the west side of the Hatchie.After we left the vicinity of the bridge and after the skirmishingceased, there was no time for order in marching, unless it was with therear-guard; no time to wait for the trains to stretch out into the roadand to follow it then in twos. We fell into the road pell-mell, andmoved in any style we wished to, in among the wagons, or any way justso we moved along and kept out of the way of those behind us. Duringthe afternoon, in the middle of the road, I stumbled upon a small pileof corn meal, half a gallon, maybe, that had sifted out of a commissarywagon, and gathered part of it into my haversack, mixed with a littledirt. I crossed the bridge away along, I suppose, about 11 P. M., afterwhich I stopped and watched General Price2019s maneuvers and the crossingof the wagons until after midnight.In the meantime I hunted around and found an old castaway tin cup,dipped up some river water and made up some dough, and then spreadingit out on a board, I laid it on General Price2019s fire until it waspartially cooked. Surely it was the most delicious piece of bread Ihave ever tasted, even to this day.When a good portion of the Third Texas had come up we moved on into theRipley road and were sent northward for a mile or two, where we layin line of battle in ambush, near the road until the trains had allpassed.After daylight we moved on towards Ripley, being again permittedto march at will, as we had marched the night before. ApproachingRuckersville my heart turned again toward my good cousin, TabithaCrook. Taking little David Allen with me, I made haste to find herhome. Arriving there a short time before dinner, I said to her,201CCousin, I am powerful hungry.201D 201COh, yes,201D she said, 201CI know you are,Willis came by home last night, nearly starved to death.201D Soon we wereinvited into her dining-room and sat down to a dinner fit for a king.Here I met her brother, George Cotten, whom I had never seen before.After dinner Mrs. Crook insisted that we rest awhile, which we did,and presently she brought in our haversacks filled up, pressed down,and running over with the most palatable cooked rations, such as fine,light biscuits, baked sweet potatoes, and such things, and my messrejoiced that night that I had good kins-people in that particular partof Mississippi, as our camp rations that night were beef without bread.We then moved on to Holly Springs and rested for some days, after afatiguing and disastrous campaign, which cost us the loss of many bravesoldiers, and lost General Van Dorn his command, as he was supersededby General J. C. Pemberton.The battle of Corinth was fought October 3 and 4, 1862. I do not knowthe number of troops engaged, but our loss was heavy. According toGeneral Van Dorn our loss was: Killed, 594; wounded, 2162; missing,2102. Total, 4858. The enemy reported: Killed, 355; wounded, 2841;missing, 319. Total, 3515. But if General Rosecrans stated thetruth, our loss was much greater than General Van Dorn gave, as he(General R.) stated that they buried 1423 of our dead, which I thinkis erroneous. Company C lost our captain, James A. Jones, mortallywounded; John B. Long and L. F. Grisham, captured. As Captain Jonescould not be carried off the field, Long remained with him and wastaken prisoner, being allowed to remain with Captain Jones until hedied. They were sent to Louisville, Ky., and then to Memphis, Tenn.,where Captain Jones lingered for three months or more. After his death,Long, aided by some good women of Memphis, made his escape and returnedto us.It was at the battle of Corinth that the gallant William P. Rogers,colonel of the Second Texas Infantry, fell in such a manner, andunder such circumstances, as to win the admiration of both friend andfoe. Even General Rosecrans, in his official report, complimentedhim very highly. The Federals buried him with military honors. Itwas at Corinth, too, that Colonel L. S. Ross, with the aid of hissuperb regiment, the Sixth Texas Cavalry, won his brigadier-general2019scommission.The evening before reaching Holly Springs we had what in Texas wouldbe called a wet norther. Crawling in a gin-house I slept on the cottonseed, and when we reached Holly Springs I had flux, with which Isuffered very severely for several days, as the surgeon had no medicinethat would relieve me in the least. In a few days we moved south toLumpkin2019s Mill, where we met our horses and were remounted, the Third,Sixth, Ninth and Whitfield2019s Legion composing the cavalry brigade,which organization was never changed. The army was soon falling backagain, and continued to do so until it reached Grenada, on the southbank of Yalabusha River.As we were now in the cavalry service we did the outpost duty for thearmy north of the Yalabusha.[Illustration: JOHN GERMANYFourth and last Captain Company C, Third Texas Cavalry]CHAPTER IXHOLLY SPRINGS RAID At Grenada2014Scouting2014Engagement at Oakland2014Chaplain Thompson2019s Adventure2014Holly Springs Raid2014Jake2014The Bridge at Wolf River2014I Am Wounded2014Bolivar2014Attack on Middleburg2014Christmas.WINTER weather came on us very early for the climate, snow havingfallen to the depth of two or three inches before the middle ofOctober, while the forests were still green, and the weather wasintensely cold all during the fall months. While in this part of thefield we had to be active and vigilant without having much fighting todo, and we enjoyed life fairly well.General Washburn was sent out from Memphis with a force, estimated tobe 10,000 men, and crossing Cold Water he came in our direction. Thebrigade in command of Lieutenant-Colonel John S. Griffith, of the SixthTexas, moved up northwest to the little town of Oakland to meet him.Starting in the afternoon we marched through a cold rain which benumbedus so that many of us were unable to tie our horses when we stoppedto camp at night. Next morning we passed through Oakland about teno2019clock and met the enemy a mile or two beyond and had a lively littleengagement with them, lasting, perhaps, half an hour, in which our mencaptured a baby cannon, somewhat larger than a pocket derringer.As we advanced in the morning, Major John H. Broocks, of the Legion,commanded the advance guard composed of a squadron of which our companywas a part. About a half mile out of the little town, when we came towhere the road forked, he halted and ordered me to take five men andgo on the left-hand road a half or three-fourths of a mile, get a goodposition for observation, and remain there until he ordered me away. Wewent on and took our position, the main force moving on the right-handroad. Very soon they met the enemy and got into an engagement with themacross a field nearly opposite our position. After awhile the firinghaving ceased, we heard our bugle sound the retreat, heard the brigademove out, and soon the Federals advanced until they had passed theforks of the road, when a battery began throwing shells at us. But noorders came from Major Broocks. Our position becoming untenable, andknowing we had been forgotten, and being unable to regain the road,we struck due south through the woods and rode all night, in order torejoin the command. Finding it next morning, Major Broocks was profusein his apologies for having forgotten us.In the fight at Oakland we had about ten men wounded, Chaplain R. W.Thompson, of the Legion, voluntarily remaining to take care of themand dress their wounds. He had gotten them into a house and was verybusy dressing the injury of one of them when a Federal soldier, witha musket in his hand, walked in and purposed making him a prisoner.Mr. Thompson was very indignant and stormed at the fellow in such amanner as to intimidate him, and he walked out and left him, andThompson went on with his duties. Presently he was again accosted, andstraightening himself up, he looked around to confront an officer andgaze into the muzzle of a cocked revolver. The officer asked, 201CWho areyou?201D 201CI am a Confederate soldier,201D said Thompson. 201CThen,201D said theofficer, 201CI guess I2019ll take you up to General Washburn2019s quarters.201D201CI guess you will not,201D replied Thompson. 201CWell, but I guess I will,201Dsaid the officer. By this time Thompson was very indignant and said:201CSir, just take that pistol off me for half a minute and I2019ll show youwhether I will go or not.201D 201CBut,201D said the officer, 201CI am not going todo that, and to avoid trouble, I guess you had better come on with me.201DSo Rev. Mr. Thompson went, and was soon introduced to the general, whosaid to him, 201CTo what command do you belong, sir?201D Thompson answered,201CI belong to a Texas cavalry brigade.201D 201CAre you an officer or private?201Dinquired the general. 201CI am a chaplain,201D said Thompson. 201CYou are ad20142014d rough chaplain,201D said the general. 201CYes,201D replied the chaplain,201Cand you would say I was a d20142014d rough fighter if you were to meet meon a battlefield with a musket in my hands.201D 201CHow many men have you inyour command, sir?201D asked the general, meaning the force he had justmet. Mr. Thompson replied, 201CWe have enough to fight, and we have enoughto run, and we use our discretion as to which we do.201D The generalstamped his foot in anger and repeated the question, and got the sameanswer. 201CYou insolent fellow!201D said the general, stamping his footagain. 201CNow,201D said Thompson in return, 201Clet me say to you, General,that if you wish to gain any information in regard to our forces thatwill do you any good, you are interrogating the wrong man.201D 201CTake thisinsolent fellow out of my presence and place him under guard!201D saidthe general. This order was obeyed, when a crowd soon began to gatheraround Thompson, growing larger and larger all the time and lookingso vicious that Thompson was actually afraid they were going to mobhim. Casting his eyes around he saw an officer, and, beckoning to him,the officer made his way through the crowd and soon dispersed it.Thompson2019s 201Cinsolence201D cost him a long march2014from there to the bank ofthe Mississippi River, where they released him, with blistered feet, tomake his way back to his command.Mr. Thompson was indiscreet, perhaps, in his manner, which was, nodoubt, detrimental to himself; but he felt conscious that they had noright to detain him as a prisoner, or to interfere with his duties,and their manner irritated him. He was a good, whole-souled man, boldand fearless, and the best chaplain I knew in the army. What I couldsay about army chaplains, so far as my observation went, would notbe flattering and, perhaps, had better be unsaid. But the Rev. R. W.Thompson, as chaplain of Whitfield2019s Texas Legion, was a success, andhe was with us in adversity as well as in prosperity. When at leisurehe preached to us and prayed for us; when in battle he was with theinfirmary corps, bearing the wounded from the field, or assisting thesurgeons in dressing their wounds and ministering to their wants. Weall loved him, and thank God he was spared to do noble work for hisMaster and his church for many years after the Civil War was over, andI believe he is still living.This Oakland affair occurred December 8, 1862. We had 1264 cavalry witha battery of four guns. Brigadier-General C. C. Washburn had 2500 menand two batteries. The engagement lasted about fifty minutes.       *       *       *       *       *In the meantime General Grant had organized a fine army of about75,000 men, including infantry, artillery, and cavalry, and was slowlymoving down the Mississippi Central Railway. His front had reached asfar south as Coffeeville, his objective point being Vicksburg, and heintended to co-operate with the river forces in taking that Confederatestronghold. General Pemberton2019s small army was gradually falling backbefore him. As the general depot of Federal supplies was at HollySprings, and to destroy Grant2019s supplies might turn him back, or atleast would cripple him more than the best fighting we could do in hisfront, this was determined on.General Earl Van Dorn, who was known to be a fine cavalry officer,was just then without a command. Lieutenant-Colonel John S. Griffith,commanding a brigade, joined by the officers of the regiments composingthe brigade, about the 5th of December petitioned General Pemberton toorganize a cavalry raid, to be commanded by General Van Dorn, for thepurpose of penetrating General Grant2019s rear, with the idea of making aneffort to destroy the supplies at Holly Springs, and to do any otherpossible injury to the enemy. In due time the raid was organized. Wetook Holly Springs, captured the guards, destroyed the supplies, andGeneral Grant was compelled to abandon his campaign.From this time General Van Dorn commanded us until his untimely deathat the hands of an assassin. A more gallant soldier than Earl Van Dornwas not to be found, and as a cavalry commander I do not believe he hada superior in either army. What I may say about this, however, hereor elsewhere, I know is of little worth, as most people have formedand expressed an opinion2014some in favor of Forrest, some Stuart, andsome Joe Wheeler; but any man who was with us on this expedition andat other times, and who watched General Van Dorn2019s maneuvers closely,studied his stratagems and noted the complete success of all hismovements, would have to admit that he was a master of the art of warin this line of the service. At the head of an infantry column he movedtoo rapidly, too many of his over-marched men failed to get into hisbattles; but place him in front of good men well mounted, and he stoodat the head of the class of fine cavalry commanders.With three brigades, ours, General W. H. Jackson2019s and ColonelMcCulloch2019s, aggregating about 3500 men in light marching order,without artillery, we moved from the vicinity of Grenada early afterdark, about the 18th of December, and marched rapidly all night. Wepassed through Pontotoc next day, when the good ladies stood on thestreet with dishes and baskets filled with all manner of good thingsto eat, which we grabbed in our hands as we passed rapidly through thetown. After passing Pontotoc a command of Federal cavalry dropped inon our rear, fired a few shots and picked up some of our men who haddropped behind. Among those picked up was our Indiana man, Harvey N.Milligan. Somehow the boys had come to doubt Milligan2019s loyalty, andsuspected that he had fallen behind purposely to allow himself to becaptured. When the rear was fired on the colonel commanding the rearregiment sent a courier up to notify General Van Dorn. The fellow cameup the column in a brisk gallop. Now, to pass from the rear to thefront of a column of 3500 cavalry rapidly marching by twos is quitea feat, but he finally reached General Van Dorn, and with a militarysalute he said: 201CGeneral, Colonel 20142014 sent me to inform you that theYankees have fired on his rear!201D 201CAre they in the rear?201D inquired thegeneral. 201CYes, sir,201D answered the courier. 201CWell, you go back,201D saidthe general, 201Cand tell Colonel 20142014 that that is exactly where I wantthem.201D It was interesting to note how adroitly he managed to keep inour rear on the entire expedition all their forces that attempted inany way to interfere with our movements. Their scouts were, of course,watching us to determine, if possible, our destination.In going north from Pontotoc, General Van Dorn, instead of taking theHolly Springs road, passing east of that place, headed his commandtowards Bolivar, Tenn. Their conclusion then was, of course, that wewere aiming to attack Bolivar. Stopping long enough at night to feed,we mounted our horses and by a quiet movement were placed on roadsleading into Holly Springs, dividing the command into two columns, soas to strike the town by two roads. We moved slowly and very quietlyduring the night, and while we were moving directly towards the townguards were placed at the houses we passed lest some citizen mightbe treacherous enough to inform the enemy of our movements. The roadour column was on was a rough, unworked, and little used one. At thefirst appearance of dawn, being perhaps three miles from town, westruck a gallop and, meeting no opposition, we were soon pouring intothe infantry camps near the railroad depot, situated in the easternsuburbs. The infantry came running out of the tents in their nightclothes, holding up their hands and surrendered without firing a gun.Our other column encountered the mounted cavalry pickets, and had alittle fight with them, but they soon galloped out of town, and onthis bright, frosty morning of December 20, A. D. 1862, the town,with its immense stores of army supplies, was ours. Standing on thetrack near the depot was a long train of box cars loaded with rationsand clothing only waiting for steam enough to pull out for the front.This was burned as it stood. Leaving the Legion to guard the prisonersuntil they could be paroled, the Third Texas galloped on uptown. Thepeople, as soon as it was known that we were Confederates, were wildwith joy. Women came running out of their houses, to their front gatesas we passed, in their night robes, their long hair streaming behindand fluttering in the frosty morning air, shouting and clapping theirhands, forgetting everything except the fact that the Confederates werein Holly Springs! On every hand could be heard shouts2014201CHurrah forJeff Davis! Hurrah for Van Dorn! Hurrah for the Confederacy!201DA mere glance at the stores2014heaps upon heaps of clothing, blankets,provisions, arms, ammunition, medicines, and hospital supplies for thewinter, all for the use and comfort of a vast army2014was overwhelmingto us. We had never seen anything like it before. The depot, the depotbuildings, the machine shops, the roundhouse, and every available spacethat could be used was packed full, and scores of the largest housesuptown were in use for the same purpose, while a great number of balesof cotton were piled up around the court-house yard. One large bricklivery stable on the public square was packed full, as high as theycould be stacked, with new, unopened cases of carbines and Colt2019sarmy six-shooters, and a large brick house near by was packed full ofartillery ammunition.For about ten hours, say from 6 A. M. to 4 P. M., we laboreddestroying, burning, this property, and in order to do this effectuallywe had to burn a good many houses. Riding out in the afternoon, to theyard where the wagons were being cut down and burned, I found numbersof mules and horses running at large, some of our men turning theirlean horses loose and taking big fat captured horses instead. Just thenit occurred to me that I had no horse of my own in Mississippi, mymount having been killed at Iuka. John B. Long being in prison when thehorses came, I was using his. Now, if I only had some way of taking oneof these horses out. Starting back uptown, puzzling over this problem,I met a negro boy coming out of a side street, and hailed him. Inanswer to my inquiries he said his name was Jake, and belonged toMr. 20142014 down at Toby Tubby2019s ferry on the Tallahatchie. 201CWhat are youdoing here?201D I inquired. 201CDese Yankees has bin had me prisoner.201D Aftera little further colloquy he readily agreed to go with me. 201CCause,201Dsaid he, 201Cyou-all done whipped de Yankees now. Dey bin braggin2019 all detime how dey could whip de rebels so fast, and when you all come inhere dis mornin2019 dey went runnin2019 everywhere, looking back to see ifde rebels was comin2019. I done see how it is now. I don2019t want nothin2019more to do with dese Yankees. I2019se bin hid under de floor all day.201D Itook one of the abandoned horses, procured a mule for Jake to ride,with saddle, bridle and halter, and taking the outfit uptown said toJake: 201CNow, when we start you fall in with the other negroes, in therear, and keep right up, and when we camp you inquire for Company C,Third Texas Cavalry2014and hold on to the horse at all hazards.201D I had nofurther trouble with Jake. He carried my instructions out all right.About 4 P. M., having finished our day2019s work, we moved out of thenortheast part of the town, and looking back we saw the Federal cavalrycoming in from the southwest.In this raid we captured about 1500 prisoners, according to General VanDorn, and General Grant said the same. They were commanded by ColonelR. C. Murphy of the Eighth Wisconsin Infantry. Poor Murphy! he wasperemptorily dismissed from the service without even a court martial.General Grant estimated their loss in supplies destroyed at $400,000,while General Van Dorn2019s estimate was $1,500,000. Doubtless one wastoo low and the other one too high. We marched out a few miles andcamped for the night, and all the evening we could hear the artillerycartridges exploding in the burning buildings.The next day early we were on the march northward. That morning when Iawoke I felt a presentiment that if we had to fight during that day Iwould be wounded, and no effort of mine was sufficient to remove theimpression, even for a moment. As the weather was quite cold, visionsof the horrors of going to prison in midwinter troubled me, since awound that would put me past riding my horse would mean that I would beleft to fall into the enemy2019s hands. Near noon we came to Davis2019 Mill,near the Tennessee line, not far from Lagrange, Tenn., where we madean effort to destroy a railroad bridge and trestle on Wolfe River. Itwas guarded by 250 troops, commanded by Colonel William H. Morgan ofthe Twenty-fifth Indiana Infantry. We were fooling about this placethree hours perhaps, and it was late before I understood the meaningof our maneuvers. Our brigade was dismounted, double-quicked here anddouble-quicked there, double-quicked back to our horses, remounted,galloped off to another place, double-quicked again somewhere elseand back to our horses. Then, remounting, we took another gallop anddouble-quicked again to the only tangible thing I saw during the day,and that was to charge a blockhouse or stockade.The enemy was in what they called a blockhouse, constructed bytaking an old sawmill as a foundation and piling up cotton bales andcross-ties, and throwing up some earthworks. Approaching this by awagon road we came to a bridge across a slough perhaps two hundredyards from their fort. We met their first bullets here, as part oftheir fire could be concentrated on this bridge. Crossing a littleriver bottom, entirely open except for a few large white oak trees,we came to a bridge across Wolfe River about seventy yards from theirworks. To charge in column across this bridge under their concentratedfire was the only chance to get to them, but coming to this bridge wefound that the floor was all gone, leaving only three stringers aboutten inches square, more or less, on which we could cross. Runningalong the bank up the river to the right was a levee some three feethigh. The men in front, five or six impetuous fellows, running on tothe stringers, one of them fell as he started across, and the otherscrossed the river. When I reached the bridge the command was deployingbehind the levee without attempting to cross. I remained near thebridge. By this time I was more fatigued, I thought, than I had everbeen, with the perspiration streaming off my face, cold as the daywas. Here we kept up a fire at the smoke of the enemy2019s guns, as wecould not see anything else, until a courier could find General VanDorn, inform him of the situation and ascertain his wishes as to theadvisability of our attempting to cross the river. Anxious to know whathad become of the men that went onto the bridge, I rose up and lookedover the levee. One of them had been killed and was lying in the edgeof the water, and the others were crouched under the opposite bankof the river out of immediate danger. While this observation onlyrequired a moment of time and a moment2019s exposure above the levee,I distinctly felt a minie ball fan my right cheek. While I had notdoubted for a moment that I was going to be shot somewhere sometimeduring the day, this narrow escape of having a minie ball plow throughmy cheek was very unpleasant. The thought of the ugly scar such a woundwould leave flashed into my mind, and wondering where I was to bewounded I settled down behind the levee and continued firing my Sharps2019rifle without exposing myself. Finally we were ordered to fall back.As soon as we were on our feet, and while crossing the little bottom,we would again be exposed to the enemy2019s fire, so the command fellback at double-quick. I rose and started, and, looking around, I sawLieutenant Germany fall, and turned back to assist him, supposing hewas shot; but as I approached him he jumped up and passed me, laughing,having merely stumbled and fallen. This threw me behind everybody. Isoon found I was so fatigued that I could not double-quick at all, soI slowed up into an ordinary walk. The command, in the meantime, toavoid the fire that could be concentrated on the slough bridge, hadflanked off to the left some distance above, and crossed on chunks andlogs that had fallen in the slough. Very soon I was the only target forthe men in the blockhouse, and they shot at me for sheer amusement. Atlast a ball struck me on the right thigh. Thinking it was broken, Istopped, bearing all my weight on my left foot, and, selecting a largewhite oak near by, intending, if I could not walk to manage somehow topull myself behind this to shield myself, I waited for 201Csomething toturn up.201D Soon learning, however, that my thigh was not broken, I movedon. Rather than lose time in going up to where the command had crossedand run the risk of being left behind, supposing that on reaching thehorses they would mount and move off, I determined to cross on thebridge, which I did in a slow walk, and am sure there was no less thana hundred shots fired at me. Somehow I felt that I was not going to beshot more than once that day, so even after I got across the bridgeand lay down to drink out of a little pool of water in the road, theirbullets spattered water in my face. I managed to get off with thecommand, and while my wound was slight it bled freely and caused me agood deal of pain, as I had to ride constantly for several days, andwas unable to dismount to fight any more on this trip.We camped not far from Davis2019 Mill, and crossed the Memphis &Charleston Railroad early next morning, cutting the telegraph wires,tearing up the track, burning cross-ties, and bending and twistingthe rails. Leaving, we struck a gallop towards Sommerville, Tenn.,and galloped nearly all day. Entering Sommerville unexpectedly, wecreated a little consternation. There was a Union mass meeting inthe town, and, there being no thought that there was a Confederatesoldier in a hundred miles of them, they were having an enthusiastictime. Some of the old gentlemen, pretty boozy on good Union whisky,stood on the streets and gazed at us with open mouths. I heard oneold fellow yell out, 201CHurrah for Sommerville!201D Another one standingnear him yelled out, 201COh, d20142014n Sommerville to h20142014l; I say hurrahfor the soldiers!201D The good ladies, however, when they learned who wewere, began bringing whatever they had to eat, handing it to us as wepassed along. Camping a few miles out, next morning we took the roadleading to Jackson, Tenn., a road which passes west of Bolivar. In theafternoon, however, we changed our course, traveling by roads leadingeastward, and camped several miles north of Bolivar.Next morning, December 24, by making demonstrations against Bolivar,General Van Dorn induced the enemy to gather all his forces in thevicinity for its defense, including 1500 cavalry under ColonelGrierson, sent by General Grant in pursuit of us. We moved down a mainroad leading into Bolivar from the north, formed fours, driving intheir cavalry scouts and infantry pickets to the very suburbs of thetown, where the column was turned to the right through alleys, byways,and vacant lots until we were south of the town, when moving quietlyout southward, we thus again had all our opposition in our rear. Movingdown the railroad seven miles, Middleburg was attacked. As our troopsdismounted and formed a line, Ed. Lewis, of Company B, was killed. Iremained mounted, with the horses. The command moved up into the townand found the enemy in a brick house with portholes, through which theyfired. This was not taken. Of Company C, A. A. Box was killed here.After staying for two hours, perhaps, we moved off just as the enemy2019scavalry from Bolivar came up and fired on our rear.The next point threatened was Corinth, in order to concentrate theforces in that neighborhood. Leaving Middleburg, we passed throughPurdy, took the Corinth road, and moved briskly until night, went intocamp, fed, and slept until 1 A. M., when we saddled up, mended up thecamp-fires and moved through neighborhood roads, into the Ripley road.Reaching Ripley at noon we rested, fed, and ate our Christmas dinner.In about two hours we moved out, and looking back we could see theenemy2019s cavalry from Corinth entering the town. They fired a piece ofartillery at us, but as they were in our rear we paid no attention tothem. Crossing the Tallahatchie at Rocky Ford we camped on the banks ofthe stream. Here General Van Dorn waited for the enemy until noon thenext day, but Colonel Grierson, who was pretending to follow us, neverput in an appearance. In the afternoon we moved to Pontotoc and campedthere that night in a terrible drenching rain. We then moved leisurelyback into our lines, with 201Cno one to molest us or make us afraid.201DCHAPTER XTHE ENGAGEMENT AT THOMPSON2019S STATION January, 18632014Jake Arrested2014Detailed2014My Brother Visits Me2014Elected Second Lieutenant2014Battle of Thompson2019s Station2014Duck River2014Capture of the Legion2014The 201CSick Camp201D2014Murder of General Van Dorn.201CTHE Holly Springs raid,201D never to be forgotten by the participantstherein, having now become a matter of history, we rested for a time.January, 1863, came, and with it a great deal of rain, making mud veryabundant and the roads very bad. During one of these cold rainy days,who should come pulling through the mud nearly half a leg deep, butthe 201Caforesaid Harvey N. Milligan, late of Indiana.201D He had made hisescape from the enemy, and, minus his horse, had made his way back tous through the rain and mud afoot. 201CI told you Milligan was all right,201Dwas a remark now frequently to be heard. A day or two after this,word came around that there were a half dozen horses at regimentalheadquarters to be drawn for by the companies. I went up to representCompany C, and drawing first choice, I selected a horse and gave himto Milligan. During that same year he deserted on that very horse, androde him into the Federal lines.My boy Jake having brought my horse out of the enemy2019s lines, of courseI expected he would wish to return home, and I proposed to give himthe mule and let him go to his master. But no, he begged me to allowhim to stay with me, to feed and attend to my horse, do my mess dutiesand such work. Of course I could not drive him off. This boy, eighteenor nineteen years old, perhaps, became a splendid servant, and as muchdevoted to me, apparently, as if I had raised him. Some months afterthis we were passing through Columbus, Miss., one day, and his owner,happening to be there, saw him, arrested him and sent him home. When Iheard of it that night of course I supposed I would never see Jake anymore, but to my surprise he came back in a short time, mounted on asplendid mule. When I started back to Texas in February, 1865, Jake wasanxious to go with me, but I gave him a horse and saddle, and told himto take care of himself.The severe horseback service we had had since the battle of Corinth,and our diet, principally sweet potatoes, had restored my healthcompletely, my wound had healed, and I was in good condition to docavalry service. At this time, too, I was detailed to work in theregimental quartermaster2019s department. We were ordered to middleTennessee, and started through the cold mud. My present position putme with the trains on a march, and we had a great time pulling throughthe mud, and in some places we found it almost impassable. Crossing theTennessee River a short distance below the foot of Mussell Shoals westruck the turnpike at Pulaski, Tenn., proceeding thence to Columbia,and then, crossing Duck River a few miles below that place, we movedup and took position near Springhill in front of Franklin, and aboutthirteen miles south of that place.One evening soon after we went into camp on the turnpike some tenmiles below Columbia, two men rode into the camp inquiring for me. Isoon learned that it was my brother, accompanied by 201CPony201D Pillow,who had come for me to go with them to Colonel Billy Pillow2019s, wholived on a turnpike three or four miles west from the one we were on.Obtaining permission, I then accompanied them. My brother had beensick for some time, and had been cared for by the Pillows, first byGranville Pillow2019s family and then by Colonel Billy2019s family. He hadnow recovered and was about ready to return to his command, which wason the right wing of General Bragg2019s army, while we were camped on theextreme left.I found Colonel Billy Pillow to be a man of ninety-four years,remarkably stout and robust for a man of his age. His family consistedof a widowed daughter, Mrs. Smith, who had a son in the army; hisson, 201CPony201D Pillow; and his wife. This old gentleman was a cousinto my grandmother Cotten, and had moved with her family and hisfrom North Carolina when they were all young people. They told meof my grandmother2019s brother, Abner Johnson, who had lived in thisneighborhood a great many years, and died at the age of 104 years. Thenext day we visited Colonel Pillow2019s sister, Mrs. Dew, a bright, brisklittle body, aged ninety-two years, and the day following we spent theday at Granville Pillow2019s. Granville Pillow was a brother of GeneralGideon J. Pillow, and nephew of Colonel Billy. He was not at home, butwe were welcomed and well entertained by Mrs. Pillow and her charmingyoung married daughter, whose husband was in the army. Mrs. Pillowinquired to what command I belonged, and when I told her I belonged toa Texas command, she asked me if I was an officer or private? When Itold her I was a private, she said it was a remarkable fact that shehad never been able to find an officer from Texas, and that the mostgenteel, polite and well-bred soldier she had met during the war was aTexas private. She added that while Forrest2019s command had camped on herpremises for several weeks, and many of them had come into her yard andinto her house, she never had found a private soldier among them. Thiswas in keeping with the 201Ctaffy201D that was continually given the Texassoldiers as long as we were in Tennessee.In the afternoon, bidding my brother farewell, I left him, overtakingmy command, as it had finished crossing Duck River and was camped onthe north bank.       *       *       *       *       *Franklin is situated on the south bank of Big Harpeth River, beingfortified on the hills north of the river overlooking the town. GeneralVan Dorn established his headquarters at Spring Hill, about thirteenmiles south of Franklin, on the Franklin and Columbia turnpike.Brigadier-General W. H. Jackson was assigned to duty as commander of adivision composed of Whitfield2019s Texas brigade and Frank C. Armstrong2019sbrigade. Many of the Texas boys were very indignant, at first, thatGeneral Jackson, a Tennessean, should be placed over them2014so muchso that they hanged him in effigy. He was sensible enough to pay noattention to this, but went on treating us so kindly and consideratelythat we all learned to respect him and like him very much.Some time in the early part of this year, 1863, Colonels J. W.Whitfield and Frank C. Armstrong were appointed brigadier-generals.Near the end of February, I think, John B. Long returned to us, andreported the death of our captain, James A. Jones, having remainedwith him until he died in Memphis, after which J. B. made his escape.First Lieutenant John Germany now being promoted to captain, and SecondLieutenant W. H. Carr promoted to first lieutenant, this left a vacancyin the officers, which was filled by my election by the company assecond lieutenant. So I gave up my position with the quartermaster andreturned to the company, quitting the most pleasant place I had everhad in the army, for Captain E. P. Hill, our quartermaster, was oneof the best and most agreeable of men, my duties were light, and mymessmates and associates at headquarters good, jolly fellows.Our duties in front of Franklin were quite active, as we had severalimportant roads leading southward to guard, and frequent skirmishesoccurred, as the pickets usually stood in sight of each other on thehills that were crossed by the turnpike roads, especially on the mainColumbian pike. In addition to the Columbia pike, running directlysouth from Franklin, there was Carter2019s Creek pike, leading southwest,and the Lewisburg pike, leading southeast. Still no considerablefighting was done until the 4th day of March, which culminated inthe battle of Thompson Station on the 5th. On the 4th, Colonel JohnCoburn of the Thirty-third Indiana Volunteers was ordered out byGeneral Gilbert, with a force of nearly 3000 men, including infantry,cavalry, and about six pieces of artillery, to proceed to Spring Hilland ascertain what was there. About four miles from Franklin theywere met by a portion of General Van Dorn2019s command, and pretty heavyskirmishing resulted, when both armies fell back and camped for thenight. Our forces retired to Thompson2019s Station, nine miles south ofFranklin, and went into camp south of a range of hills running acrossthe pike just south of the station. This is a very hilly country, andthe Nashville & Decatur Railroad runs through a little valley betweentwo ranges of hills, and the station is in the valley a short distancewest of Columbia pike.On the morning of the 5th the enemy was found to be advancing again,and leaving our horses behind the hill, we crossed over to the northside, and near a church just south of the station we were formed behinda stone fence2014that is, Whitfield2019s brigade, other troops to our rightand left, our artillery being posted to our right on the hill near thepike. The enemy advanced to the range of hills north of the station,on which was a cedar brake. From our position back to the hill andcedar brake was an open field with an upgrade about half a mile wide,the station, with its few small buildings, standing in between thelines, but much nearer to us. The Federal artillery was posted, parton each side of the pike, directly in front of ours, and the batteriessoon began playing on each other. Colonel Coburn, not seeing our lineof dismounted men behind the stone fence, ordered two of his infantryregiments to charge and take our batteries, and they came sweepingacross the field for that purpose. When they came to within a shortdistance of our front, Whitfield2019s brigade leaped over the fence,and, joined by the Third Arkansas, of Armstrong2019s brigade, chargedthem, and soon drove them back across the open field, back to the hilland cedar brake, their starting point. Here they rallied, and beingre-enforced they drove our forces back to the station and stone fence,where, taking advantage of the houses and stone fence, our forcesrallied and, being joined by the remainder of General Armstrong2019sbrigade, drove them back again. This attack and repulse occurred threesuccessive times. In the meantime General Forrest, with two regimentsof his brigade, had been ordered to move around to the right and gaintheir rear, and as they retired to their hill and cedar brake the thirdtime, Forrest opened fire on their rear, and they threw down their gunsand surrendered2014that is, those that were still upon the field. Theirartillery, cavalry, and one regiment of infantry had already left.The engagement lasted about five hours, say from 10 A. M. to 3 P. M.Our loss was 56 killed, 289 wounded, and 12 missing; total, 357. Theenemy2019s loss was 48 killed, 247 wounded, and 1151 captured; total,1446. Among the captured were seventy-five officers, including ColonelCoburn, the commander, and Major W. R. Shafter, of the NineteenthMichigan, who is now Major-General, and one of the heroes of theSpanish-American war.[3]Company C lost Beecher Donald, mortally wounded. Among the killedof the Third Texas of my acquaintances I remember Drew Polk (alias201CRedland Bully201D), of Company E, and Sergeant Moses Wyndham, a friend ofmine, of Company A. From the day of the Oak Hill battle up to this daywe had never been able to get T. Wiley Roberts into even a skirmish,but to-day he was kept close in hand and carried into the battle, butran his ramrod through his right hand and went to the rear as relatedin this chronicle. Among the losses was Colonel S. G. Earle, of theThird Arkansas, killed; and my friend H. C. Cleaver, an officer inthe same regiment, was wounded. Rev. B. T. Crouch of Mississippi, achaplain, was killed while acting as aide-de-camp to General Jackson.Captain Broocks, brother of Lieutenant-Colonel John H. Broocks, wasalso killed.The dwelling houses in the vicinity of Thompson2019s Station were situatedin the surrounding hills overlooking the battlefield, but out ofdanger, and from these houses a number of ladies witnessed the battle.When they saw the enemy being driven back they would clap their handsand shout, but when our forces were being driven back they would hidetheir eyes and cry. Thus they were alternately shouting and crying allday, until they saw nearly twelve hundred of the enemy marched out andlined up as prisoners, and then they were permanently happy.Here we lost the beautiful flag presented to us in the IndianTerritory, the staff being shot in two, while in close proximity tothe enemy. The bearer picked it up, but as he had to make his escapethrough a plum thicket the flag was torn into narrow ribbons and lefthanging on the bushes.[Illustration: JESSE W. WYNNECaptain Company B, Third Texas Cavalry]General Van Dorn had four brigades under his command at thistime2014Forrest2019s brigade of four regiments and a battalion, Martin2019sbrigade of two regiments, Armstrong2019s brigade of two regiments, onebattalion, and one squadron, and Whitfield2019s brigade of four Texasregiments. All these participated, more or less, in the battle, but asJackson2019s division was in the center the brunt of the battle fell onthem, as the losses will show. Whitfield lost 170 men, Armstrong, 115,Forrest, 69, and Martin, 3.General Gordon Granger took command at Franklin immediately after thebattle of Thompson Station. He and General Van Dorn were said to beclassmates at West Point, and good friends personally, but it seemedthat they made strenuous efforts to overreach or to out-general eachother.About March 8 another expedition was sent out by the enemy apparentlyfor the purpose of driving us out of the neighborhood. Skirmishingbegan on the Columbia and Lewisburg pikes, some three or four milessouth of Franklin, and was continued on the Columbia road for aboutthree days, until we fell back across Rutherford Creek and took astrong position behind a range of hills south of the creek, destroyingthe bridges. In the meantime heavy rains were falling, the creek risingso that General Granger2019s forces were delayed about two days in theirefforts to cross, and all that could be done was to skirmish acrossthe creek. Duck River, just behind us, rose so high and ran so swift,that pontoon bridges could not be maintained across it. A battle couldnot be risked with only a small ferryboat in such a stream. Stillthe skirmishing went on, until the trains and artillery were ferriedacross, when, leaving skirmishers on the hill to deceive the enemy,we moved up the river through cedar brakes to White2019s bridge, twentymiles, crossed to the south side of the river, and when the enemycrossed Rutherford Creek they found no rebels in their front. We moveddown through Columbia, and five or six miles down the Mount Pleasantturnpike and went into camp.201CPony201D Pillow2019s wife had been kind enough to knit me a pair of fineyarn gauntlets, and having heard that we had crossed Duck River, shesent them to me, by her husband, who came up soon after we struck camp.While he was there I was ordered to take a squad of men whose horsesneeded shoes, go into the country and press one or two blacksmithshops, and run them for the purpose of having a lot of shoeing done.I got my men and went home with Pillow, took charge of shops in theneighborhood, and was kept on duty there about eight days, staying withmy old grand-cousin2019s family every night. I enjoyed this opportunity oftalking with the old gentleman very much, as he had known my maternalgrandparents when they were all children in Guilford County, NorthCarolina, before the Revolutionary War. He, himself, had been a soldierfor eight years of his life, and had been shot through the body witha musket ball. In these war times he loved to talk about his exploitsas a soldier. While I was there he mounted his horse and rode severalmiles through the neighborhood, to the tanyard and the shoe shop, toprocure leather and have a pair of boots made for his grandson, who wasin the army.The work of shoeing the horses having been completed, and Duck Riverhaving subsided, we crossed back to the north side again, taking upour old position near Spring Hill, and resumed our picketing andskirmishing with General Granger2019s forces. It is unnecessary, even ifit were possible, to allude to all these skirmishes. The picket poston Carter2019s Creek pike, eight miles from Franklin, was regarded asimportant for some reason, and an entire regiment from our brigade waskept there. One regiment for one week and then another regiment for thenext, and were sent there with strict orders to have horses saddledand everything in readiness for action at daybreak in the morning. TheThird Texas had been on the post for a week, and was relieved by theLegion under Lieutenant-Colonel Broocks. The Legion had been there twoor three days, and had grown a little careless, as nothing unusualhad ever happened to any of the other regiments while on duty there.Just at daybreak one morning in the latter part of April Granger2019scavalry came charging in upon them and completely surprised them intheir camps, before they were even up, and captured men, horses, mules,wagons, cooking utensils2014everything. Colonel Broocks and some of hismen made their escape, some on foot and some on horseback, but morethan a hundred were captured, their wagons cut down and burned, theircooking utensils broken up, and their camp completely devastated. Oneof the escaped men came at full speed to our camps, some three milesaway, and as quick as possible we were in our saddles and gallopingtowards the scene of the disaster2014but we were too late. We gallopedfor miles over the hills in an effort to overtake the enemy andrecapture our friends, but failed.We all felt a keen sympathy for Colonel Broocks and his men, for noofficer in the army would have felt more mortification at such anoccurrence than the brave, gallant John H. Broocks. It was said that hewas so haunted by the sounds and scenes of the capture of his regimentthat he was almost like one demented, and that for days and daysafterwards he would sit away off alone on some log, with his head down,muttering, 201CHalt! you d20142014d rebel, halt!201DAt one time during April General Van Dorn, with a goodly number ofhis command, made a demonstration upon Franklin, drove in all theiroutposts, and, selecting the Twenty-eighth Mississippi Cavalry andleading it himself, he charged into the heart of the town.The night following the race we made after the Broocks2019 captors,my horse fell sick and became unfit for service. In consequence Iwas ordered to send him to the pasture in charge of the command, afew miles below Columbia, and take command of 201Cthe sick, lame, andlazy camp201D on Rutherford Creek, a temporary camp made up of slightlydisabled men, and men with disabled horses or without horses. I was onduty here two weeks, with about as little to do as could be imagined.It was while I was on duty here that General Van Dorn2019s death occurredat his headquarters at Spring Hill. He was assassinated by one Dr.Peters, who was actuated by an insane jealousy. Dr. Peters was anelderly man, with a pretty young wife; General Van Dorn was a gay,dashing cavalier. Dr. Peters was in the general2019s office when he camein from breakfast, and asked the general to sign a pass permitting himto pass through the picket lines. As General Van Dorn was writing hissignature to the paper, Dr. Peters stood behind him. When Van Dorn hadgiven the last stroke with the pen, the doctor shot him in the back ofthe head, and, having his horse ready saddled, he mounted and gallopedup to our pickets, passed through, and made his escape. As soon as thecrime was known a number of the general2019s escort mounted their horsesand gave chase, but they were too late to stop the doctor.In a few days after this very sad occurrence General Jackson2019s divisionwas ordered to Mississippi by rapid marches, and about the middle ofMay we reluctantly bade adieu to this beautiful, picturesque middleTennessee.CHAPTER XITHE SURRENDER OF VICKSBURG Moving Southward2014I Lose My Horse2014Meet Old Huntsville Friends2014A New Horse2014In Mississippi2014201CSneeze Weed201D2014Messenger2019s Ferry2014Surrender of Vicksburg2014Army Retires2014Fighting at Jackson2014After Sherman2019s Men2014A Sick Horse2014Black Prince2014201CTax in Kind201D2014Ross2019 Brigade2014Two Desertions.I NOW disbanded my important command on Rutherford Creek, and tellingmy men that every fellow must take care of himself, I joined themovement towards Mississippi. Leaving in the afternoon, we campedon the north bank of Duck River opposite Columbia. That night whilewalking into a deep gully I sprained an ankle very badly. Next morningmy foot and ankle were so swollen I could not wear my boot, so Iexchanged it for an old rusty brogan shoe found in an ambulance, andshipped all my luggage in the ambulance. I made my way to the pastureeight miles below, mounted my horse and joined the command.Before reaching camp that night my horse was taken with a peculiarlameness in one of his hind legs. Next morning soon after startinghe became lame again, and grew rapidly worse, so much so that I fellbehind, being unable to keep up. Soon I had to dismount and lead him,driving him and urging him along in every possible way, spending theday in that manner, and walking most of the time. In the afternoonI saw that contingent called stragglers. One man rode up and said tome, 201CHello, Barron! you are gone up for a horse. You2019ll have to haveanother. Have you got any money?201D 201CNot much,201D I replied. Pulling out aone hundred dollar bill, he said: 201CHere, take this; it will do you somegood.201D During the afternoon another, and after a while still anotherpassed me, saying and doing precisely the same thing. Crossing ElkRiver just before dark, I stopped to spend the night at the first houseon the road. The next morning my horse was dead. I had expected totrade him, but now I was completely afoot, encumbered with my rigging,fifteen miles behind the command, which had gone on the Athens, Ala.,road.After visiting the lot I went back to breakfast, feeling that I was agood many miles from home, but not particularly daunted. I had all thetime believed that a soldier who volunteered in the Confederate armyin good faith and was honestly doing his duty would come out of allkinds of difficulties in good shape. After breakfast I watched the roaduntil noon. At last a man of our brigade came along leading a horse,and I inquired to whom he belonged. 201COne of the boys that was sent tothe hospital.201D I then explained to him my situation. 201CAll right,201D saidhe, 201Cyou take this pony, find you a horse, and leave the pony withthe wagon train when you come to it.201D 201CThe pony201D was a shabby littlelong-haired mustang with one hip bone knocked down, but I was mountedfor the time.It was now Saturday afternoon. I was only thirty miles from Huntsvilleand might find a horse there, so it occurred to me, but I had nodesire to go there at this time. In the condition circumstances hadplaced me, I only wished to procure a horse suitable for my necessitiesand follow my command. I mounted the mustang and took the Huntsvilleroad, inquiring for horses along the way. I stayed all night at MadisonCross roads, and was not recognized by the man at whose house I spentthe night, although I had been acquainted with him for several years. Iwent out next morning, Sunday as it was, and examined and priced one ortwo horses in the neighborhood, but found I could not pay for one evenif I had fancied him, which I did not. So I continued my course towardsHuntsville, jogging along very slowly on my borrowed horse, as theweather was quite warm. When within two or three miles of town I leftthe Pulaski road and turned in through some byways to the residence ofMr. Tate Lowry, a friend of mine who lived near the Meridianville pike,a mile or two out of town. I rode up to his place about noon, just ashe had returned from church. He extended me a very cordial welcome tohis house, which was only occupied by himself, his good old mother,and little boy. We soon had a good dinner. Out in the office I enjoyeda short sleep, a bath, and began dressing myself, Mr. Lowry coming inand placing his entire wardrobe at my service. I was soon inside of anice white shirt and had a pair of brand new low-quartered calfskinshoes on my feet. He then brought me a black broadcloth frock coat, butthere I drew the line. Having a neat gray flannel overshirt, I donnedthat, buckled on my belt and felt somewhat genteel. As there were tobe religious services at the Cumberland church in the afternoon, weagreed to go into town. We walked in, however, as I had no dispositionto show the mustang to my friends in town, and when we arrived at thechurch we found the congregation assembled and services in progress. Iwent quietly in and seated myself well back in the church, and when theservices ended everybody, male and female, came up to shake hands, allglad to see me, among them my home folks, Mrs. Powers (201CAunt Tullie201D),and Miss Aggie Scott, her niece. I accompanied them home, and met Mr.W. H. Powers, with whom I had lived and worked for several years,and who was my best friend. I found it a delightful experience to behere after an absence of more than three and half years. Of course Iexplained to them why I was in Huntsville and how I became lame. OnMonday morning Mr. Powers called me in the parlor alone, and said tome, 201CDo you need any money?201D 201CThat depends,201D I said, 201Con the amount ahorse is going to cost me.201D 201CWell,201D he said, 201Cif you need any, let meknow, and at any time that you need any money, and can communicate withme, you can get all the Confederate money you need.201D During the day ourL. H. Reed came in from the command, bringing me a leave of absence toanswer my purpose while away from the command.Here I met my friend (Rev. Lieutenant-Colonel W. D. Chadick), who saidto me upon learning my purpose in this neighborhood: 201CI have a goodhorse I bought very cheap, to give my old horse time to recover from awound. He is about well now, and as I cannot keep two horses you canhave him for what he cost me.201D 201CHow much was that?201D 201CThree hundreddollars.201D 201CAll right,201D said I, 201Cthe three one hundred dollar billsare yours, and the horse is mine.201D This animal was a splendid sorrel,rather above medium size, about seven years old, sound as a dollar, anda horse of a good gaits. When I had gone forty miles from Huntsvilleone thousand dollars of the same currency would not have bought him. OnTuesday I had him well shod, mounting him the next morning, and whileI was sorely tempted to remain longer, I started for Mississippi. Ireally had a very bad ankle, and could have called on an army surgeonand procured an extension of my leave and spent a few days more in thisdelightful way, but hoping to be well enough to perform the duties thatcame to my lot by the time I reached the command, I pulled myself away.I went out and got the pony, left the borrowed articles of clothing,and crossing Tennessee River at Brown2019s Ferry, I laid in corn enoughbefore I left the valley to carry me across the mountains whereforage was scarce. I strapped it on the pony and made good time toColumbus, Miss. Here I was detained several hours by Captain Rice, thepost commander, much against my will. He claimed that he was orderedby General Jackson, in case he found an officer in the rear of thecommand, to detain him until he gathered up a lot of stragglers, whowere to be placed in charge of the officer, to be brought up to thecommand. After worrying me several hours, he turned me over a squad ofmen, and I started out with them. As soon as I crossed the TombigbeeRiver I turned them all loose, and told them I hoped they would go totheir commands; as for me, I was going to mine, and I was not going toallow a squad of men to detain me for an instant.I passed through Canton about dark one evening, and learning what roadthe command was probably on, having left my pony as per instructions,I rode into our camp just at midnight. The next morning we moved toMechanicsburg, loaded, capped, and formed fours, expecting to meetthe enemy, which, however, did not prove to be the case. I thereforewas able to be at my post by the time the first prospect of a fightoccurred.On my way down one day, I passed where the command had camped on asmall creek, and noticing several dead mules I inquired into the cause,and was told they were killed from eating 201CSneeze weed,201D a poisonousplant that grows in middle and southern Mississippi. I learned toidentify it, and as we had several horses killed by it afterwards, Iwas very careful when we camped, to pull up every sprig of it withinreach of my horse.On the long march from Spring Hill, Tenn., to Canton, Miss., Company Chad the misfortune to lose four men2014Dunn, Putnum, and Scott deserted,and McCain was mysteriously missing, and never heard of by us again.       *       *       *       *       *General U. S. Grant had swung round with a large army through Jackson,Miss., fought a battle with General Pemberton at Raymond and another atBaker2019s Creek, Champion Hill, where General Pemberton was driven back,having General Loring2019s division and twenty pieces of his artillerycut off. Pemberton was compelled to fall back across Big Black Riverat Edward2019s Depot into Vicksburg with the remainder of his army, andGeneral Grant had thrown his army completely around Vicksburg on theland side, and that city was besieged. We were sent down here to hoveraround the besieging army, to see that they 201C2018have deyselves, and keepoff our grass.201D The large gunboats in the river, above and below, withtheir heavy ordnance were bombarding the city. These huge guns couldbe heard for many miles away, from early morning until night. When Ifirst heard them I inquired the distance to Vicksburg, and was told itwas a hundred miles. During the siege we had active service, drivingin foraging parties, picketing, scouting, and occasionally skirmishingwith the enemy.About the first of July we drove the enemy2019s pickets from Messenger2019sFerry, on Big Black River, and held that crossing until the 5th.Vicksburg was surrendered on the 4th, and on the evening of the 5thour pickets were driven from the ferry by a large force under GeneralSherman, who began crossing the river and moving east. General JosephE. Johnston was in command of our army outside of Vicksburg, and at thetime the city was surrendered he was down on Big Black, with his forcesand a train loaded with pontoons2014everything indicating his intentionto attempt a cut through the enemy2019s line to relieve General Pemberton.As soon as the surrender occurred General Johnston began falling backtowards Jackson, and we fought the advancing enemy several days whilehe was making this retrogressive movement. We fought them daily, fromearly in the morning until late in the afternoon, holding them incheck, though some days they advanced several miles and others onlytwo or three, owing to the nature of the ground and the more or lessfavorable position afforded us. This detention gave General Johnstontime to move his trains and infantry back at leisure and to get hisarmy in position in front of Jackson. Finally falling back to Jackson,we passed through our infantry lines in front of the city and took ourposition on the extreme right wing of our army, beyond the northernsuburbs of the city. Jackson, it may be well to state, is located onthe west bank of Pearl River. General Sherman2019s right wing rested onPearl River south of the city, and his lines extended in a semicirclearound the west of the city. Here we fought more or less for abouta week, with some pretty severe engagements, directly in front ofthe city. In passing through the northern portion of the city to theposition assigned to us we passed the State Lunatic Asylum. After weformed a line and everything was quiet, there being no enemy in ourfront, Joe Guthery, of Company B, sauntered out and reconnoitered alittle and upon his return he approached Captain Jesse Wynne and said:201CCaptain, you ought to see General Johnston2019s fortifications down bythe asylum. He2019s got a great big swiege gun planted there that demandsthe whole country around.201DOne afternoon our works were assaulted by a brigade of General Lauman2019sdivision, who were almost annihilated. For this move he was promptlysuperseded, as it was claimed he acted without orders. After some heavyfighting in front of the city I chanced to pass our field hospitalwhere the surgeons were at work, and just behind the hospital I lookedinto an old barrel about the size of a potato barrel and discovered itwas nearly full of stumps of arms and legs, bloody and maimed, just asthey had fallen under the knife and saw. This to me was so ghastly asight that I never remember it without a shudder.As we had heretofore been dismounting to fight, I had not had anopportunity of trying my new horse under fire until now. We had along line of skirmishers in extension of our line to the right infront of us and three or four hundred yards from a line of the enemy2019sskirmishers. They were in the brush not exposed to view, so a desultoryfire was kept up all along the line. I was sent up the line to deliversome orders to our men, and as I had to ride up the entire line andback, the enemy2019s skirmishers soon began firing at me, and kept it upuntil I made the round trip, the minie balls constantly clipping thebushes very near me and my horse. This completely demoralized him, andhe would jump as high and as far as he possibly could every time heheard them. Some horses seem to love a battle, while others are almostunmanageable under fire. The first horse I rode in the army was lazyand had to be spurred along ordinarily, but when we were going intoa battle and the firing began he would champ the bits, pull on thebridle, and want to move up.After some four days in front we were sent to the rear of Sherman2019sarmy, where we captured a few wagons and ambulances and destroyed somecotton, and upon returning encountered the enemy2019s cavalry at Canton.While we were on this enterprise General Johnston had retired fromJackson and fallen back to Brandon, and General Sherman, after a fewdays, returned to Vicksburg. Our brigade now moved out into RankinCounty for a rest. Here orders were issued for thirty-day furloughs toone officer and three men of the company. As Lieutenant Hood was awayon sick leave, I proposed to Lieutenant Carr that we would concedeCaptain Germany the first leave. No, he would not do that; he was asmuch entitled to it as Captain Germany. 201CAll right,201D said I; 201Cthenwe2019ll draw for it, and I will be sure to get it.201D The drawing turnedout as I had prophesied, and I presented the furlough to CaptainGermany. The furloughs those days had a clause, written in red ink,201Cprovided he shall not enter the enemy2019s lines,201D and that meant that inour case our men should not go to Texas.In this 201CSiege of Jackson,201D as General Sherman called it (July 10-16,1863), the enemy2019s reported losses in killed, wounded and missingnumbered 1122. I am unable to give our losses, but in the assaults theymade we lost very few men. General Sherman had three army corps on thisexpedition.Our rest near Pelahatchie Depot was of short duration, as we weresoon ordered back to guard the country near Vicksburg on the BigBlack and Yazoo Rivers, with headquarters at Bolton Station. DuringSherman2019s occupation of Jackson he had destroyed miles of railroadtrack, bridges, and depots, and had also destroyed rolling stock,including passenger cars, flat cars, and locomotives. Now in August aforce of their cavalry came out from Memphis and undertook to stealall the rolling stock on the Mississippi Central Railroad. They camedown about as far as Vaughan2019s Station and gathered up the rollingstock, including a number of first-class locomotives, intending torun them into Memphis or Grand Junction. We were sent after them andhad a lively race. As they were about twenty-four hours ahead of usthey would have succeeded, doubtless, had not some one burned a bridgeacross a small creek opposite Kosciusko. As may be imagined, we gavethem no time to repair the bridge. We moved about a hundred miles intwo days, with no feed for men or horses except green corn from thefields.Reaching Durant very late at night in a drenching rain we were turnedloose to hunt shelter in the dark as best we could, and we had a greattime getting into vacant houses, under sheds, awnings, in stables orany available place that we might save our ammunition. At Old Shongolo,near Vaiden, the good ladies had prepared a splendid picnic dinner forus, but as we could not stop to partake of it they lined up on eachside of the column as we passed, with waiters loaded with chicken,ham, biscuit, cake, pies, and other tempting viands and the men helpedthemselves as they passed, without halting.One evening we stopped just before night to feed, for the horses werehot and tired, and our men hungry and in need of sleep. The horses werehastily attended to, that we might get some sleep, as we were to remainhere until midnight, then resume the march. At starting time I foundmy horse foundered. Groping my way through the darkness to GeneralWhitfield2019s headquarters, I told him I could not go on, for my horsewas foundered. 201COld Bob2019s in the same fix,201D he said. 201CCross Big BlackRiver as soon as you can, and go back to the wagon train, and tell thatfellow that has got old Bob to take good care of him.201DAs the command moved off I started in the opposite direction. I hadonly gone a short distance when I came up with Lieutenant Barkley ofthe Legion, in the same sad condition. After daylight we stopped tobreakfast at a house on the road, then crossed the Big Black, and, asour horses grew worse, we made a short day2019s travel and spent the nightwith Mr. Fullylove, a generous old gentleman. Next morning the horsestraveled still worse. About 10 A. M. we came to the residence of Hon.Mr. Blunt, of Attalah County, and decided that, with the permission ofthe family, we would remain here until morning. Consulting Mrs. Blunt,she said: 201CMr. Blunt is not at home. The only persons with me are mydaughter and a young lady visiting us; but if I knew you were gentlemenI would not turn you off.201D We told her we were Texans, and claimedto be gentlemen2014and we remained there until the next morning. Aftercaring for our horses we were invited into the parlor or sitting-roomand introduced to the young ladies. The visitor was Miss Hattie Savage,who lived only a few miles away. Soon the usual interrogatory waspropounded. 201CAre you gentlemen married?201D Barclay answered: 201CYes, I ammarried. I have a wife and baby at home,201D and exhibited the littleone2019s picture. I told them I was not so fortunate as to be married.Soon we had a good dinner and spent quite a pleasant day. The nextmorning, with many thanks for the generous hospitality we had enjoyed,we said good-by to the three ladies.I found that my horse2019s condition grew constantly worse, so that nowhe could scarcely get along at all. After traveling about three mileswe came to the house of Mr. Leftwich Ayres, who proved to be a veryexcellent man. Seeing the condition of our horses, he invited us toremain with him until morning, which we did. At this time and everafterward I received only kind and generous treatment from all themembers of this family, which consisted of Mr. Ayres, his wife and hergrown daughter, Miss Joe Andrews. A Mr. Richburg owned and operateda tanyard and boot shop near the Ayres place. I visited his shop andleft my measure for a pair of boots, and found Mr. Richburg to be amost excellent man. He made me several pairs of boots afterwards. Nextmorning Mr. Ayres said to me: 201CYour horse cannot travel. Old Arkansawis the only horse I have; take him and ride him, and I will take careof your horse until he is well.201D I accepted the proposition, andBarclay and myself returned to our commands.General Whitfield followed the Federals to Duck Hill, near Grenada,without overtaking them, and returned to Canton, and to Big Black andYazoo Rivers.When I supposed from the lapse of time that my horse had recovered, Iobtained permission and went after him. Reaching Mr. Ayres2019 home aboutten o2019clock one morning, he met me at the gate and told me that myhorse was about well, that he had just turned him out for the firsttime to graze. I immediately felt uneasy, and being anxious to seehim we walked around his inclosure and soon found him; but as soon asI came near him I saw the effects of the deadly sneeze weed, and inspite of all we could do for him in a few hours he was dead. Mr. Ayreswas very much grieved and said, 201CI would not have had your horse dieat my house under the circumstances for a thousand dollars. There2019sold Arkansaw; take him and make the best you can of him2014ride him,trade him off, or anything.201D I therefore returned to the command on OldArkansaw, a pretty good old one-eyed horse.It is not possible now to remember all the movements made by us duringthe next two or three months, the number of foraging parties we droveback or the number of skirmishes with the enemy. As I have said Ireturned to the command mounted on Old Arkansaw, but did not keep himlong, as I traded him for a pony, and traded the pony for a mule, asplendid young mule, good under the saddle, but not the kind of a mountI desired. Awaiting for a favorable time, I obtained leave to go toHuntsville, where I could obtain money to buy another horse. I soonmade the distance over the long road at the rate of forty miles perday on my mule. Passing through Tuscaloosa one morning, after a travelof thirty-two miles, I put up with Mr. Moses McMath, father-in-law ofGeneral Joseph L. Hogg. Here I found General L. P. Walker, our firstSecretary of War, who had started to Huntsville. We traveled togetheras far as Blountsville, he relating to me many interesting facts aboutthe early days of the Confederate army, and here we learned that adivision of Federal cavalry was then in Madison County.At Warrenton, in Marshall County, I met Hop Beard, son of Arthur Beard,who had lost one of his hands in Forrest2019s cavalry, and had a horsewhich he was now willing to sell. From Warrenton I went to Lewis2019 Ferryon Tennessee River, fifteen miles below Huntsville. Here I found myhalf-brother, J. J. Ashworth. Crossing the river at this place I wentup on the Triana road as far as William Matkin2019s, about seven milesfrom Huntsville. Here I found Miss Aggie Scott, of the household of myfriend, W. H. Powers, and was advised that it was unsafe to go to town.I therefore sent a message to Mr. Powers by Dr. Leftwich, who lived inthe neighborhood, and he brought me seven hundred dollars. With thisI returned to Warrenton and purchased a splendid black horse of Mr.Beard, really the best horse for the service that I had owned. I calledhim Black Prince. With the horse and mule I returned to Mississippi. Ihad met several Huntsville people at Warrenton, among them my friendTate Lowry. He insisted that when I got back to Noxubee County,Mississippi, that I stop and rest at his plantation. I reached thereabout ten o2019clock one rainy day, and remained there until next morning.I found his overseer a clever, agreeable man, and the plantation avery valuable property, and was shown the fine stock and everythingof interest on the place. Noticing a long row of very high rail pensfilled with corn, I remarked on the fine crop of corn he had made.201COh,201D said he, 201Cthat is only the tax in kind where I throw every tenthload for the Government.201D And that was really only one-tenth of hiscrop! Our government claimed one-tenth of all produce, which was called201Ctax in kind.201DAs I passed through Macon I was offered five hundred dollars for mymule, but I had determined to carry it back and give it to Mr. Ayresin place of Old Arkansaw. I rode up to Mr. Ayres2019 house about threeo2019clock in the afternoon, presented him with the mule, and remainedthere until morning. While there Mrs. Ayres gave me enough of theprettiest gray jeans I ever saw, spun and woven by her own hands, tomake a suit of clothes. I sent to Mobile and paid eighty-five dollarsfor trimming, such as buttons, gold lace, etc., and had a tailor makeme a uniform of which I justly felt proud.In September, perhaps it was, General Whitfield, on account of failinghealth, was transferred to the trans-Mississippi department, and theRev. R. W. Thompson, the Legion2019s brave chaplain, also left us andrecrossed the Mississippi. The brigade was commanded alternately byColonel H. P. Mabry, of the Third Texas, and Colonel D. W. Jones, ofthe Ninth, until Colonel L. S. Ross, of the Sixth Texas, was appointedbrigadier-general and took permanent command of us, and the brigade wasever after known as Ross2019 Brigade. Colonel Mabry was given command of aMississippi brigade and sent down on the river below Vicksburg.Early in December we attempted to capture a foraging party that cameout from Vicksburg. Starting early in the night, Colonel Jones was sentwith the Ninth Texas around to intercept them by coming into the roadthey were on near the outside breastworks. The command moved slowlyuntil morning, when coming near the enemy we gave chase, galloping tenmiles close at their heels. When they passed the point Colonel Joneswas trying to reach he was in sight. We ran them through the outerbreastworks and heard their drums beat the long roll. When we turnedabout to retire two of our men, Milligan and Roberts, fell back andentered the enemy2019s breastworks and surrendered.CHAPTER XIIBATTLE AT YAZOO CITY Midwinter2014Through the Swamps2014Gunboat Patrols2014Crossing the Mississippi2014Through the Ice2014Ferrying Guns2014Hardships2014Engagement at Yazoo City2014Harrying Sherman2014Under Suspicion2014A Practical Joke2014Battle at Yazoo City2014Casualties2014A Social Call2014Eastwood2014Drowning Accident2014A Military Survey.THE early days of January, 1864, found us floundering through theswamps in an effort to deliver to the trans-Mississippi departmenta lot of small arms, rifles, and bayonets. General Stephen D. Lee,commander of the cavalry in our department, wrote General Ross thatthere had been two or three unsuccessful efforts to put two thousandstands of arms across the Mississippi, and asking whether he thoughthis command could put them over. General Ross replied, 201CWe will try.201DSo the brigade started with several wagons loaded with the arms and abattery of four pieces. This January proved to be the coldest month ofthe war, and for downright acute suffering from exposure and privationprobably no month of our campaigning equalled this.We crossed Yazoo River at Murdock2019s ferry, and pretty soon were inSunflower Swamp, about eight miles across. A slow rain was fallingand the weather very threatening. With all the teams we had and allthe oxen that could be procured in the vicinity, an all-day2019s job,we reached Sunflower with one lone piece of artillery, every otherwheeled vehicle being hopelessly bogged down in the swamp from twoto five miles in our rear. While the command was crossing the rivera blizzard swooped down upon us. By the time we reached a camp twomiles beyond, icicles were hanging from our horses, and everything wepossessed that was damp was freezing. The cold continued to increase,next morning everything was frozen stiff, and it would have beenpossible to skate on the ponds near the camps. In this state of affairsGeneral Ross said to us: 201CWhat shall we do, give up the expedition ortake these guns on our horses and carry them through?201D The boys said:201CCarry them through.201D We mounted and rode back to the river, left thehorses on the bank and crossed in a ferryboat, where ensued a grandrace for the wagons across the rough, frozen ground and ice, for ona fellow2019s speed depended the distance he would have to go for theload of guns he was to carry back to the horses. Warren Higginbothom,an athletic messmate of mine, passed me, and I asked him to save mesome guns at the first wagon, which he did, and I returned to campwith other fortunate ones; but some of them were late in the nightreturning. So we remained in the same camp for another night. Many ofthe men were thinly clad and poorly shod for such a trip in the bittercold weather, I myself being clad in a thin homespun gray jean jacket,without an overcoat; and having hung my gloves before the fire to dryand gotten them burned to a crisp, I was barehanded as well.The next morning every man, including General Ross himself, took hisquota of the guns, usually four apiece, and started to Gaines2019 ferry,on the Mississippi, about fifty miles distant. Passing through BogueFolio Swamp about seven miles, crossing the stream of that name andpassing through the Deer Creek country, the garden spot of Mississippi,we came to within about three miles of the river and camped in a drycypress swamp. As the river was closely patrolled by gunboats our aimwas to cross the guns over at night. As no craft that a man could crossthe river in was allowed to remain in the river, we found a smallflatboat and dragged it with oxen over the frozen ground to the river,walking with loads of guns to meet it. The river here was runningsouth and the cold north wind was coming down stream in almost a gale.The water was low and we approached it on a wide sandbar. Having slidthe boat into the water, John B. Long, Nathan Gregg, of Company A, SiJames, the Choctaw, and one other of the command volunteered to rowit over. After it was well loaded with guns the boat was pushed off,but the strong wind drifted them down the river some distance, and,returning, they drifted down still farther, so that it was nine o2019clocknext morning when they returned to camp, with their clothes from theirwaists down covered with a sheet of ice so thick that they could notsit down. The first gunboat that passed destroyed the little flat. Wethen built another small boat, but before we could get it ready for useall the eddy portion of the river near the bank was frozen over and thecurrent a mass of floating ice, so that it was impossible to cross insuch a craft at night. Procuring two skiffs in addition to the boat, wecrossed the remainder of the guns over in daylight, pushing throughthe floating ice with poles, the guns being delivered to ColonelHarrison2019s command on the west bank of the river. For the days andnights we were engaged in crossing these guns we lived on fresh porkfound in the woods, eating this without salt, and a little corn parchedin the ashes of our fires. The weather continued to grow colder, untilthe ice was four inches thick on the ponds. The guns being disposed of,the piece of artillery was run down to the bank of the river, when soona small transport came steaming up the river. It was given one or twoshots, when it blew a signal of distress and steamed to the oppositeshore and landed, and was soon towed off by a large boat going up theriver. With some of our men barefooted and many of them more or lessfrost-bitten we returned to Deer Creek, where we could get rationsand forage. As for forage there were thousands of acres of fine cornungathered, and we only had to go into the fields and gather what wewanted. The Federals had carried off the able-bodied negroes, and thecorn was still in the fields, and along the creek and through the farmsthere were thousands and thousands of wild ducks. I am sure I saw moreducks at one glance than I had seen all my life before. We retraced oursteps through the swamps and the canebrakes and recrossed the YazooRiver in time to meet a fleet of twelve transports, loaded with whiteand black troops, escorted by two gunboats, ascending that river,evidently making for Yazoo City.[Illustration: CAPTAIN H. L. TAYLORCommander Ross2019 Brigade Scouts]The Third Texas was sent out to meet a detachment of the enemy movingup the Mechanicsburg and Yazoo City road, and drove them back towardsVicksburg, the rest of the brigade, in the meantime, fighting the riverforce at Satartia and Liverpool. The Third rejoined the brigade atLiverpool, but being unable to prevent the passage of the enemy, wemoved rapidly up the river and beat them to Yazoo City. Placing ourartillery in some earthworks thrown up by Confederates in the earlypart of the war, we formed a line of riflemen down at the water2019s edge.The fleet soon came steaming up the river, and when the front gunboatcame opposite to us the battery began playing upon it, while the rifleskept their portholes closed so that they could not reply. It was notlong before they abandoned the effort to land, dropped back and weresoon out of sight down the river. Later in the day, from the smoke, wecould see that they were steaming up Sunflower River, west of us.When the people of Yazoo City saw that we had saved their town fromoccupation by negro troops, their gratitude knew no bounds, and thisgratitude was shown practically by as great a hospitality as was everextended by any people to a command of Confederate soldiers. In theevening a squadron, including Company C, was left on picket below thecity for the night, at the point occupied during the day, while thecommand moved out on the Benton road to camp. To the pickets during theevening the citizens sent out cooked provisions of the nicest and mostsubstantial character, sufficient to have lasted them for a week.The next morning the brigade returned and as everything remainedquiet, with no prospect of an early return of the enemy2019s fleet, Irode uptown to take a view of the city. Numbers of others had done thesame, and as the hour of noon approached we began to get invitationsto dinner. Meeting a little white boy, he would accost you thus: 201CMr.Soldier, Mamma says come and eat dinner with her.201D Next a little negroboy would run up and say: 201CMr. Soldier, Mistis say come and eat dinnerwith her.201D And this manner of invitation was met on every corner, andbetween the corners. I finally accepted an invitation to dine with thefamily of Congressman Barksdale.We were not allowed to enjoy the hospitality of this grateful citylong on this visit, as General Sherman, who had planned a march tothe sea, moved eastwardly out from Vicksburg, with a formidable forceof infantry and artillery, and we were ordered to follow him. Thiswe did, and kept his infantry closed up and his men from straggling.His cavalry, moving out from Memphis, was to form a junction withhis main force at Meridian. Reaching that place, he halted, and wecamped in the pine wood three or four miles north of the town. GeneralForrest was between us and the enemy2019s cavalry, and our object was toprevent a junction, thus defeating the purpose of the expedition, andif Forrest was unable to drive the cavalry back we were to go to hisassistance2014that is, Jackson2019s division was to do this.One very cold, cloudy evening near sundown I was ordered to report toGeneral Ross, mounted. When I reached headquarters I received verbalorders to proceed to Macon with the least possible delay, take chargeof some couriers already there, use the telegraph, ascertain GeneralForrest2019s movements, and report from time to time by courier. Thedistance to Macon was, say, forty-five or fifty miles, and the wayled mainly through forests, with a few houses on the road. Clad in mygray jean jacket, without overcoat or gloves, but well mounted andarmed, I started, alone. Soon after dark a light snow began to falland continued all night. About midnight I reached DeKalb, the countyseat of Kemper County, where I spent half an hour in an effort to rousesomebody who could put me on the road to Macon. At daylight I wasseveral miles from my destination. Stopping at a house for breakfastI lay down before the fire and slept while it was being prepared, andafter breakfast finished my journey.Approaching Macon from the south I crossed Noxubee River, spanned bya splendid covered bridge, and noticed that it was so filled withtinder that it easily might be fired if the Federal troops should comein sight. As I rode into the town and halted to make some inquiries,quite a number of citizens gathered around me to learn who I was,and ask for the news. One sympathetic old gentleman, seeing that myhands were bare and cold, stepped up and presented me with a pair ofgloves. I found that the citizens were scared and excited, as they weresituated between Sherman and his cavalry. I endeavored to allay theiruneasiness, and advised them not to burn the bridge, even if the enemyshould appear, as that would only cause a temporary delay, and would bea serious loss to the town and country. From this they concluded I wasa spy in the interest of the enemy, as I learned later, and for a dayor two my every movement was closely watched.I now put up my horse, found my couriers, repaired to the telegraphoffice, and informed the operator of my instructions. I spent most ofthe time in the telegraph office, when late at night the operator toldme of the suspicion that I was a spy, and that he had cleared it up byasking General Jackson over the wires who I was. After this, while onthis duty, I was treated with great kindness.General Jackson now moved up to re-enforce General Forrest, andI rejoined the command as it passed Macon. We moved up as far asStarkville, but, learning that the enemy2019s cavalry had been drivenback, we returned to the vicinity of Meridian. As was expected, GeneralSherman began falling back towards Vicksburg, we following him.Arriving at Canton, Sherman, taking an escort, returned to Vicksburg,leaving his army to follow in command of General MacPherson. Underhis command the Federal army moved without straggling and withoutfurther depredations. We learned from this improved condition of armydiscipline to respect MacPherson, and regretted to learn of his beingkilled in battle in front of Atlanta in July.It was as the enemy returned on this trip that a battalion of Federalcavalry passed through Kosciusko, and their commander played apractical joke on the Union merchants there. These merchants, when theylearned the Federals were coming, closed their doors and met them inthe outskirts of town, and were loud in their assertions of loyalty tothe Union. The officer asked them if they had done anything for theUnion they loved so much. 201CNo,201D said they, 201Cwe have had no opportunityof doing anything, being surrounded by rebels as we are.201D 201CWell,201D saidthe officer, 201Cwe2019ll see. Maybe I can give you a chance to do a littlesomething for the Union.201D Moving on uptown he found the rebels withopen doors, and, in riding round, he would ask them why they had notclosed up. They answered that they were so-called rebels, and were atthe mercy of him and his men, and if their houses were to be plunderedthey did not wish the doors broken, and so they would offer noresistance. He placed guards in all the open doors, with instructionsto permit no one to enter; then turning to his men, he told them ifthey could find anything they wanted in the houses that were closed, tohelp themselves, which they did. And thus an opportunity was given the201Cloyal201D proprietors to do something for the Union.Ross2019 brigade returned to Benton on the 28th of February, and was inthe act of going into camps at Ponds, four miles down the plank roadtowards Yazoo City, when a squadron of negro cavalry from the city camein sight. General Ross ordered detachments of the Sixth and Ninth Texasto charge them. The negroes after the first fire broke in disorder andran for dear life. The negro troops, a short time previous to this,had caught and murdered two of the Sixth Texas, and as these fellowswere generally mounted on mules very few of them got back inside thebreastworks, these few being mostly the white officers, who were bettermounted than the negroes. Among the killed along the road was found anegro that belonged to Charley Butts, of Company B, he having run awayto join the First Mississippi Colored Cavalry.On the evening of March 4 Brigadier-General Richardson, with hisbrigade of West Tennessee Cavalry, joined General Ross for the purposeof assisting in driving the enemy from Yazoo City, which is situatedon the east bank of Yazoo River. The city with its surroundings wasoccupied by a force of about 2000 white and negro troops, commandedby Colonel James H. Coats, supported by three gunboats. About eighto2019clock on the morning of March 5, 1864, the city was attacked by Ross2019and Richardson2019s brigades, Brigadier-General L. S. Ross in command.Our fighting strength was about 1300 men, with two or three batteries;but as we dismounted to fight, taking out the horse-holders, everyfourth man, this would reduce our fighting strength to about 1000 men.The enemy had the advantage of several redoubts and rifle-pits, themain central redoubt being situated on the plank road leading fromBenton to Yazoo City. We fought them nearly all day, and at times thefighting was terrific. With the Third Texas in advance we drove intheir pickets and took possession of all the redoubts but the largercentral one. This one was in command of Major George C. McKee, of theEleventh Illinois Regiment with nine companies: about four companies ofthe Eighth Louisiana negro regiment; Major Cook, with part of his FirstMississippi negro cavalry, the same that had murdered the two SixthTexas men; and one piece of artillery. The Third and Ninth Texas andFourteenth Tennessee cavalry found themselves confronting this redoubt.Two of our batteries were placed so as to obtain an enfilading fireat easy range, and threw many shells into the redoubt, but failed todrive the enemy out. In the meantime General Richardson, with the restof his brigade, the Sixth Texas and the Legion, drove the remainderof the enemy2019s forces entirely through the city to the protection oftheir gunboats, and gained possession of the entire place except oneor two brick warehouses near the bank of the river, behind which theirtroops had huddled near the gunboats. The Sixth Texas and Legion tookposition on the plank road in rear of the large redoubt, and thus atfour o2019clock in the afternoon we had it entirely surrounded, we beingin front some 150 yards distant. At this juncture General Ross sentMajor McKee a flag of truce and demanded an unconditional surrender.The firing ceased and the matter was parleyed over for some time. Thefirst message was verbal, and Major McKee declined to receive it unlessit was in writing. It was then sent in writing, and from the movementswe could see, we thought they were preparing to surrender. But theyrefused, owing perhaps to the fact that General Ross declined torecognize the negro troops as soldiers; and how they would have faredat the hands of an incensed brigade of Texas troops after they hadmurdered two of our men in cold blood was not pleasant to contemplate.As for the negro troops,2014well, for some time the fighting was underthe black flag2014no quarter being asked or given. Retaliation is one ofthe horrors of war, when the innocent are often sacrificed for theinhuman crimes of the mean and bloodthirsty.The parley in reference to surrendering being at an end, little morefiring was indulged in, as both parties seemed to have grown tired ofshooting at each other. The troops were under the impression that wewere to assault the redoubt, but instead of doing so we quietly retiredjust before nightfall, and returned to our camp on the Benton road.This was explained by General Ross in his report in this way: 201CTo havetaken the place by assault would have cost us the loss of many men,more, we concluded, than the good that would result from the captureof the enemy would justify.201D Our loss in this engagement was: Ross2019brigade, 3 killed and 24 wounded; Richardson2019s brigade, 2 killed and 27wounded; total, 56. The enemy reported: 31 killed, 121 wounded, and 31missing; total, 183.Among our severely wounded was John B. Long, of Company C. Early in theday, ten o2019clock perhaps, he was shot down on the skirmish line and wascarried off the field and the word came down the line: 201CJohn B. Longis killed.2014John B. Long is killed.201D This was heard with many regrets,as he was a favorite soldier in the command. This report was regardedas true by all of us at the front, until we returned to our camp. Thenext morning I found him in Benton, wounded in the head; unconscious,but not dead, and he is not dead to this day (August, 1899). The nextmorning all the enemy2019s forces left Yazoo City, and again Ross2019 brigadewas regarded as an aggregation of great heroes by these good people.One morning while we were camped in this neighborhood, one of theboys came to me with an invitation to visit a lady residing betweenour camps and Benton. She wished to see me because I had lived inHuntsville, Ala. When I called I found Mrs. Walker, daughter-in-law ofGeneral L. P. Walker, of Huntsville. She was a beautiful young woman,bright, educated and refined, easy and self-possessed in manner, anda great talker. She lived with her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, herhusband being in the army. Mrs. Walker was an enthusiastic friend ofthe brigade, and would not admit that they had ever done anythingwrong, and contended that, inasmuch as they had defended the cityand county so gallantly, anything they needed or wanted belonged tothem, and the taking it without leave was not theft. And this was thesentiment of many of these people.For the remaining days of March we occupied practically the sameterritory we had been guarding from the fall of Vicksburg. On or aboutthe last of March General Ross sent Colonel Dudley W. Jones, in commandof the Third and Ninth Texas regiments, to attack the outpost of theforce at Snyder2019s Bluff, destroy Yankee plantations, etc., etc. I didnot accompany this expedition, I am sure, as I have no recollection ofbeing with it; nor do I now remember why I did not do so. The Yankeeplantations alluded to were farms that had been taken possession ofby Northern adventurers, and were being worked under the shadow ofthe Federal army by slaves belonging to the citizens. Cotton beinghigh, they expected to avail themselves of confiscated plantationsand slaves to make fortunes raising cotton. Colonel Jones captured anddestroyed at least one such plantation, captured one hundred mules,some negroes, and also burned their quarters.Early in April we started east, with the ultimate purpose of joiningGeneral Joseph E. Johnston2019s forces in Georgia, moving by easy marches.There was some dissatisfaction among the men on account of heading ourcolumn toward the rising sun, as they had been promised furloughs onthe first opportunity, and this looked like an indefinite postponementof the promised boon. Arriving at Columbus, Miss., we rested, and hereLieutenant-General Leonidas Polk, then commanding the department,made a speech to the brigade, alluding to the fact that they had beenpromised furloughs, postponed from time to time, and assured us that assoon as the present emergency ended Ross2019 brigade should be furloughed.He assured the men that he had the utmost confidence in their braveryand patriotism, and though it had been hinted to him, he said, that ifhe allowed these Texans to cross the Mississippi River they would neverreturn, he entertained no such opinion of them.We now moved from Columbus to Tuscaloosa, Ala., the former capital ofthat grand old State. The good people of this beautiful little cityon the banks of the Black Warrior had never before seen an organizedcommand of soldiers, except the volunteer companies that had beenorganized here and left the city and vicinity, and their terror andapprehensions when they learned that a brigade of Texans had arrivedwas amusing. They would not have been in the least surprised if wehad looted the town in twenty-four hours after reaching it. As weremained here several days, and went in and out of the city in a quietorderly manner, they soon got over their fears. There were numbers ofrefugees here from Huntsville, Florence, and other north Alabama towns,and some of us found acquaintances, especially General Ross and hisadjutant-general, Davis R. Gurley, who had been in college at Florence.During our stay the ladies gave several nice parties for the benefitof the brigade. While we were here a great many fish were being caughtin a trap above the city, and the men would sometimes go at night inskiffs up to the trap and get the fish. On one occasion LieutenantCavin, Harvey Gregg, and a man named Gray, of Company A, went up, andgetting their boat into a whirlpool, it was capsized and the men thrownout into the cold water, with overcoats and pistols on. Gregg and Graywere drowned and Cavin was barely able to get out alive.After several days we moved some miles south of the city, where foragewas more convenient. In the meantime General Loring, with his division,had come on from Mississippi. Receiving an invitation through CaptainGurley to attend a party given by a Florence lady to him and GeneralRoss, I went up and spent two or three days in the city. While thereI visited my friends in Loring2019s division, and also visited the StateLunatic Asylum, where I found in one of the inmates, Button Robinson,of Huntsville, a boy I had known for years. I also attended a drill ofthe cadets at the university. Friends of the two young men that weredrowned had been here dragging the river for their bodies for somedays, and finally they got one of General Loring2019s batteries to fireblank cartridges into the water, and their bodies rose to the surface,when they were taken out and buried.The mountainous country lying north of Tuscaloosa and south of theTennessee valley was at this time infested with Tories, deserters,201Cbushwhackers,201D and all manner of bad characters, and it was reportedthat the Tories in Marion County were in open resistance. So on themorning of the 19th of April Colonel D. W. Jones, of the Ninth, wassent with detachments of the Sixth and Ninth Texas and a squadronfrom the Third, under Captain Lee, amounting in all to about 300 men,up into that county to operate against these Tories. On the samemorning I was ordered to take fifteen men of Company C and accompanyLieutenant De Sauls, of the Engineers2019 Corps, from Tuscaloosa, upthe Byler road to Decatur, on the Tennessee River, and return by wayof the old Robertson road, leading through Moulton and Jasper to thestarting point, for the purpose of tracing out those roads to completea military map then in preparation. Applying to the quartermaster andcommissary for subsistence for my men and horses, I was instructedto collect 201Ctax in kind.201D We moved out in advance of Colonel Jones2019command. Our duties on this expedition necessitated our stopping atevery house on the road to obtain the numbers of the lands,2014that is,the section, township, and the range,2014ascertain the quarter section onwhich the house stood, learn the names of all creeks, note all crossroads, etc., etc. I subsisted the men and horses on tax in kind, whichI had to explain to the poor people in the mountains, as they had neverheard of the law. There was not much produced in this country, andthere were so many lawless characters in the mountains that the taxcollectors were afraid to attempt to collect the impost. The peopleoffered me no resistance, however, and to make the burden as light aspossible I would collect a little from one and a little from another.I had the horses guarded every night, but really had no trouble. I metwith one misfortune, much deplored by me, and that was the killing ofJames Ivey by Luther Grimes, but under circumstances that attached noblame to Grimes in the eyes of those who saw the occurrence, as Iveymade the attack and shot Grimes first, inflicting a scalp wound on thetop of his head. I reported the facts when I reached the command, andthere was never any investigation ordered.CHAPTER XIIIUNDER FIRE FOR ONE HUNDRED DAYS Corduroy Breeches2014Desolate Country2014Conscript Headquarters2014An 201CArrest201D2014Rome, Ga.2014Under Fire for One Hundred Days2014Big and Little Kenesaw2014Lost Mountain2014Rain, Rain, Rain2014Hazardous Scouting2014Green Troops2014Shelled2014Truce2014Atlanta2014Death of General MacPherson2014Ezra Church2014McCook2019s Retreat2014Battle Near Newnan2014Results.WE reached General Roddy2019s headquarters near Decatur, on Saturday, andrested until Monday noon. Starting back we passed through Moulton, werecaught in a cold rain, sheltered our horses under a gin-shed, and sleptin the cotton seed without forage or rations. Next morning I instructedthe men to find breakfast for themselves and horses, and meet me atMr. Walker2019s, down on the road. Taking DeSauls and one or two others,I went on to Mr. Walker2019s, a well-to-do man, who owned a mill, where Ihoped to get breakfast and some rations and forage to carry us acrossthe mountain. Arriving at Walker2019s, he came out to the gate and Iasked him first about forage and rations to take with us, and he saidwe could get them. Leaving DeSauls to question him about his land, Isought the lady of the house to arrange for breakfast. I found hervery willing to feed us, as we were from eastern Texas, and knew ofher father, who lived in Rusk County. Now DeSauls was a resident ofNew Orleans, was dressed in a Confederate gray jacket and cap, andwore a pair of corduroy trousers. Soon after the lady left the frontroom to have breakfast prepared, DeSauls came in with a fearful frownon his face and said to me: 201CBarron, don2019t you think that d20142014d oldscoundrel called me a Yankee?201D 201COh,201D said I, 201CI guess he was joking.201DJust at this time Mr. Walker came up, looking about as mad as DeSauls,and said, 201CNo, I am not joking. I believe you are _all_ Yankees; lookat them corduroy breeches! There hasn2019t been a piece of corduroy in theSouth since the war began, without a Yankee wore it.201D I treated thematter as a joke at first, until finding that the old gentleman was indead earnest, I undertook to convince him that he was wrong, but foundit no easy matter. Finally I asked him the distance to Huntsville?Forty miles. Then through my familiarity with the people and country inand around Huntsville I satisfied him that he was wrong, and then wewere treated kindly by him and his family.After leaving Tennessee valley we passed through the most desolatecountry I ever saw. For more than a day2019s march I found but one or twohouses inhabited, and passing through the county seat of Winston CountyI was unable to find any person to tell me the road to Jasper. Arrivingat Tuscaloosa I learned that Colonel Jones had returned and that thebrigade had gone to Georgia, and I followed it, passing through Elyton,Blountsville, Talledega, and Blue Mountain. Camping one night atBlountsville, I met my friend Bluford M. Faris, formerly of Huntsville.Arriving at Talledega, I determined to spend one day, Saturday, therein order to have some shoeing done. This was conscript headquartersfor a large area of country, with a major commanding, and there waspost-quartermaster, commissary, a provost marshal, and all the pomp andcircumstance of a military post. I thought at one time I would havesome trouble, but fortunately I came out all right.In the first place I camped in a grove of timber convenient to water,but soon received a message from the commander that I had camped nearhis residence, and would I move somewhere else? He did not want men todepredate upon his premises. I replied that I would make good everydepredation my men committed, and that it was not convenient for me tomove. I was busy for some time in procuring rations, forage, and anorder for horseshoeing, and about the time I had these matters arrangedI got a message requesting me to come to the provost marshal2019s office.On my way I saw my men out in line of battle near the court-house, withguns loaded and capped. Calling one of them to me, I learned that oneor two of them had gone into the provost2019s office and he had cursedthem as d20142014d stragglers belonging to a straggling brigade, and theygave him back some rough words, whereupon he had threatened to arrestthem, and they were waiting to be arrested. Coming to the office Ifound the man in charge was a deputy. Introducing myself, I inquiredwhat he wanted. He said some of my men had been to his office andcursed him, and he had threatened to arrest them and wished to knowif I could control them. I told him I could control them as easily asI could control that many little children, but if he wished to arrestany of them, the men were just out there and he might send his menout to attempt it2014if he could. I asked him what provocation he hadoffered, and made him acknowledge that he had called them 201Cstragglers.201DI then told him they were not stragglers, but good soldiers and,besides, they were all gentlemen, and if he had not first insulted themthey would have treated him in a gentlemanly way; that if he wished todeal with them to proceed, otherwise I would take charge of them. Oh,no, he did not wish to have any trouble. If I was willing for my mento take a drink, I had his permission, and the poor fellow was morethan willing to turn the 201Cstragglers201D over to me. I called them allup, accompanied them to a saloon, and told them that those who wishedit could take a drink. We then went about our business without furthertrouble.From Talladega I proceeded to Blue Mountain, intending to go from thereto Rome, but learning that our army was gradually falling back, andbeing unable to learn its position or when I could safely calculate onstriking it in the flank, I turned my course southward, passed throughCarrolton, crossed the Chattahoochee River, followed the river up toCampbellton, recrossed it and found my command fighting near new NewHope church on the 20142014 day of May, 1864.       *       *       *       *       *A detailed account of this campaign would make a large volume, andof course cannot be undertaken in these brief recollections. Ourdivision of cavalry reached Rome, Ga., about the middle of May, andfought the Federal advance the same day, and then for one hundreddays were under fire, with the exception that on two occasions we wereordered to follow cavalry raids sent to our rear. But for this briefrespite we were under constant fire for this period, each day andevery day. We were assigned a position on the extreme left of GeneralJ. E. Johnston2019s army, a position occupied by us during the entirecampaigning, while General Joe Wheeler2019s cavalry was on the extremeright.To give one day2019s duty is practically to give the duties of many otherdays. We always fought on foot. Sometimes behind breastworks, sometimesnot, sometimes confronting infantry and sometimes cavalry. We wouldbe up, have our horses equipped, form a line, detail horse-holders,and march to the front by daybreak, and take our position on thefighting line. About nine o2019clock our cooked rations, consisting ofone small pone of corn bread and three-eighths of a pound of bacon,was distributed to each man as we stood or lay in line of battle.While these rations would not have made a good hearty breakfast, theyhad to last us twenty-four hours. The skirmishing might be light orheavy, we might charge the enemy2019s works in our front, or we might becharged by them. Usually the musket-firing, and often artillery-firing,would be kept up until night, when leaving a skirmish line at thefront, we would retire to our horses. We often changed position afternight, which involved night marching, always changing in a retrogrademovement. Sometimes the fighting would become terrific, for at timesGeneral Sherman would attack our whole line, miles and miles in length,and, under General Johnston these attacks were made with heavy loss toSherman2019s army. Particularly was this the case in front of Big Kenesaw,Little Kenesaw, and Lost Mountain.In this campaign the cavalry service was much harder than the infantryservice. When night came on the infantry could fall down and sleep allnight unless they had to change their position, while the cavalry wereburdened with their horses. Marching back to our horses we hustled forall the forage the Government could furnish us, which was usually aboutone quart of shelled corn, and we were compelled to supplement thiswith something else, whatever we could find; sometimes it was oats,often green crab grass from the fields, and later, green fodder or peavines. Often this gathering of horse feed lasted until ten or eleveno2019clock, when the horses would be stripped and we could sleep, providedwe were not to move.Early in June it began to rain, and continued raining day and nightfor about twenty-five days, until the country was so boggy that it wasalmost impossible to move artillery or cavalry outside of the beatenroads. Sometimes when the rain was pouring down in torrents the enemywould be throwing shrapnels at us, and hundreds, perhaps thousands, ofthem without exploding, plunged into the soft earth and are doubtlessthere yet. During the rainy season there was a great deal of thunderand lightning, and artillery duels would occur either day or night, andsometimes it was difficult to distinguish between the thunder of heavenand the thunder of cannon and bursting shells. On one of those veryrainy days we were in some timber south of a farm, while the enemy wasin the timber north of it, only a few hundred yards distant, and hadbeen firing at us in a pretty lively manner. General Ross sent for meand told me to go ascertain how far the enemy2019s line extended beyondour left. I mounted my horse and rode off, conning over in my mind theperplexing question as to how I was to gain the desired information, asthe enemy in the thick woods could not be seen, and I could think of noother method than to ride into the field in view of their skirmishers,draw their fire and move on until the end of their line was apparent.Accordingly I rode into the open field and moved along some distancewithout being shot at; looking across the field near the oppositefence, I fancied I saw a line of skirmishers just inside of it, andtried in vain to attract their attention at long range. I rode back andforth, getting nearer to them all the time, until I got close enoughto discover that the fancied pickets were black stumps, an illusionoccasioned by the fact that a man in dark blue uniform on a rainy daylooks black at a distance of two or three hundred yards. I was thenworse puzzled than at first, for to go back and tell General Ross thatI could not learn anything about their lines would never do. Aftera little hesitation I threw down the fence and rode into the thickundergrowth, expecting every minute to meet a volley of bullets. Goingon some little distance I heard the word 201CHalt!201D I halted, and was soongratified to learn that I was confronting a small Confederate scoutingparty. Informing them of my object, they proposed showing me what Iwas looking for, and I was therefore able to return and report to mygeneral, sound in body and much easier in mind.During this long rainy spell we rarely slept two nights on the sameground and never had a dry blanket to sleep on. On the 3d day ofJuly we fought General Schofield2019s Corps nearly all day, fightingand falling back (as they were pushing down a road leading to SandTown, a crossing on the Chattahoochee River), passing through a lineof breastworks on the crest of a ridge crossing the road at rightangles, erected and occupied by the Georgia Militia, about the middleof the afternoon. As we passed into the breastworks one of our men waskilled by a long-range ball. The militia had never been under fireand had never seen a man killed before. We were instructed to form aline immediately in their rear and rest, and to support them if theenemy should come; but beyond throwing a few shells over the works andskirmishing at long range, we had no farther trouble with the enemythat afternoon. Our men were very much amused at the sayings and doingsof the militia at this time, but subsequently the Georgia militia werecommanded by General G. W. Smith, an experienced officer, and afterthis they acted very gallantly in battle. They retired at night and we,leaving skirmishers in the works, went into camp. The next morning theThird Texas went into these breastworks, and while Captain Germany andmyself were out in front deploying skirmishers he was severely woundedjust below the knee, and was unfit for duty for several months.General Schofield2019s Corps advanced in solid line of battle, and wereallowed to take the works while we fell back a short distance intothe timber and heard them give three cheers for Abe Lincoln, threecheers for General Sherman and three cheers for General Schofield! Wethen fought them again back through the timber until we came to a laneleading between farms across a little valley nearly a mile wide. Onthe hill beyond was our infantry in breastworks, and just beyond thebreastworks was the narrow river bottom and Sand Town crossing, anddown in this little bottom were our horses. As we entered the lane theenemy ran a battery up to the edge of the timber and shelled us everystep of the way as we pulled through the long lane, tired and dusty,about noon, that hot 4th of July. Passing through the breastworks wemounted our horses in a shower of shells and crossed the river. Here werested for twenty-four hours.I went into Atlanta on the morning of the 5th, and skirmishing acrossthe river again began in the afternoon. Here for some days we had acomparatively easy time, only picketing and skirmishing across theriver. As this seemed void of results, the men on the north and southside of the river would agree upon a truce and go in bathing together.They would discuss the pending race for President between Lincolnand McClellan. The Confederates would trade tobacco for molasses andexchange newspapers, and when the truce was at an end each side wouldresume its respective position, and the firing would be renewed.There continued to be more or less fighting north of the river untilJuly 9, when General Johnston fell back into the defenses immediatelyin front of Atlanta. General Sherman2019s army also crossed the river andconfronted General Johnston2019s lines near the city. On or about the 19thGeneral Johnston was superseded by General John B. Hood, and then begana series of hard battles around Atlanta, which were continued on the20th, 21st, 22d, and other days, in which the losses on both sides wereheavy. The Federal general, James B. MacPherson, was killed on the 22d.On the 28th was fought the battle of Ezra Church. On this day CompaniesC and D of the Third Texas were on picket in front of our command, andin the afternoon were driven back by overwhelming numbers, John B.Armstrong being slightly wounded and R. H. Henden very severely wounded.We were soon met with orders to mount and move out to Owl Rock churchon the Campbellton and Atlanta road, to assist Colonel Harrison, whowas understood to be contending with General McCook2019s division ofcavalry. General McCook had crossed the river near Rivertown, not farfrom Campbellton, for the purpose of raiding in our rear, and GeneralStoneman, with another division, had simultaneously moved out aroundthe right wing of our army. The purpose was for these two commands toco-operate and destroy the railroad in our rear. General Wheeler2019scavalry was sent after Stoneman. As General McCook had at least twelvehours the start of us we were unable to overtake him until afternoonof the next day. In the meantime, before daylight, he struck the wagontrain belonging to our division, burned ninety-two wagons and capturedthe teamsters, blacksmiths, the chaplain of the Third Texas, and theinevitable squad that managed under all circumstances to stay with thetrain. We came up with McCook2019s command near Lovejoy Station, whichis on the railroad thirty miles below Atlanta. We learned with joythat General Wheeler had overtaken Stoneman, captured him and a largeportion of his command, and was able to come with a portion of histroops to assist in the operations against McCook. McCook now abandonedall effort to destroy railroad property, and began a retreat in orderto get back into the Federal lines. We followed him until night when,as we had been in our saddles twenty-eight hours, we stopped, fed ongreen corn and rested a few hours. Some time before daylight nextmorning we mounted and moved on briskly. Early in the day we came closeupon the enemy2019s rear and pressed them all day, during which time wepassed scores of their horses, which from sheer exhaustion had beenabandoned. Many of our horses, too, had become so jaded that they wereunable to keep up.[Illustration: LEONIDAS CARTWRIGHTCompany E, Third Texas Cavalry; Member of Taylor2019s Scouts, Ross2019Brigade]About the middle of the afternoon, when near Newnan, the Federalsstopped to give us battle. They had chosen a position in a dense skirtof timber back of some farms near the Chattahoochee River bottom, andhere followed a battle which I could not describe if I would. I canonly tell what the Third Texas did and sum up the general result. Wewere moved rapidly into the timber and ordered to dismount to fight. Asmany of our men were behind, instead of detailing the usual number ofhorse-holders, we tied the horses, leaving two men of the company towatch them. Almost immediately we were ordered into line, and before wecould be properly formed were ordered to charge, through an undergrowthso dense that we could only see a few paces in any direction. As I wasmoving to my place in line I passed John Watkins, who was to remainwith the horses, and on a sudden impulse I snatched his Sharpe2019scarbine and a half dozen cartridges. On we went in the charge, whoopingand running, stooping and creeping, as best we could through thetangled brush. I had seen no enemy in our front, but supposed theymust be in the brush or beyond it. Lieutenant Sim Terrell, of CompanyF, and myself had got in advance of the regiment, as it was impossibleto maintain a line in the brush, Terrell only a few paces to my right.Terrell was an ideal soldier, courageous, cool, and self-possessed inbattle. Seeing him stop I did likewise, casting my eyes to the front,and there, less than twenty-five yards from me, stood a fine specimenof a Federal soldier, behind a black jack tree, some fifteen inches indiameter, with his seven-shooting Spencer rifle resting against thetree, coolly and deliberately taking aim at me. Only his face, rightshoulder, and part of his right breast were exposed. I could see hiseyes and his features plainly, and have always thought that I looked atleast two feet down his gun barrel. As quick as thought I threw up thecarbine and fired at his face. He fired almost at the same instant andmissed me. Of course I missed him, as I expected I would, but my shothad the desired effect of diverting his aim and it evidently saved mylife.Directly in front of Terrell was another man, whom Terrell shot in thearm with his pistol. The Federals both turned around and were in theact of retreating when two or three of Terrell2019s men came up and inless time than it takes to tell it two dead bodies lay face downwardswhere, a moment before, two brave soldiers had stood. I walked up tothe one who had confronted me, examined his gun, and found he had firedhis last cartridge at me. Somehow I could not feel glad to see thesetwo brave fellows killed. Their whole line had fallen back, demoralizedby the racket we had made, while these two had bravely stood at theirposts. I have often wondered what became of their remains, lying awayout in the brush thicket, as it was not likely that their comrades everlooked after them. And did their friends and kindred at home ever learntheir fate?We moved forward in pursuit of the line of dismounted men we hadcharged, and came in sight of them only to see them retreating acrossa field. Returning to our horses we saw them stampeding, as ColonelJim Brownlow, with his regiment of East Tennesseans, had gotten amongthem, appropriated a few of the best ones, stampeded some, while therest remained as we had left them. We charged and drove them away fromthe horses and they charged us three times in succession in return,but each time were repulsed, though in these charges one or two of thebest horses in the regiment were killed under Federal riders. Thesemen were, however, only making a desperate effort to escape, and wereendeavoring to break through our lines for that purpose, as by thistime General McCook2019s command was surrounded and he had told hisofficers to get out the best they could. In consequence his army hadbecome demoralized and badly scattered in their effort to escape. Theprisoners they had captured, their ambulances, and all heavy baggagewere abandoned, everything forgotten except the desire to return totheir own lines. General Stoneman had started out with 5000 men andGeneral E. M. McCook had 4000. Their object was to meet at LovejoyStation, on the Macon Railroad, destroy the road, proceed to Macon andAndersonville and release the Federal prisoners confined at those twoplaces. This engagement lasted about two hours, at the end of which wewere badly mixed and scattered in the brush, many of the Confederatesas well as Federals not knowing where their commands were.General Ross summed up the success of his brigade on this expeditionas follows: Captured, 587, including two brigade commanders, withtheir staffs; colors of the Eighth Iowa and Second Indiana; elevenambulances, and two pieces of artillery. General Wheeler2019s men alsocaptured many prisoners. Our loss on the expedition was 5 killed and27 wounded. Among the wounded I remember the gallant Lieutenant TomTowles, of the Third. The command now returned to its position inGeneral Hood2019s line of battle, the prisoners being sent to Newnan,while I was ordered to take a sufficient guard to take care of themuntil transportation could be procured to send them to Andersonville.I had about 1250 enlisted men and 35 officers, who were kept here forseveral days. I confined them in a large brick warehouse, separatingthe officers from the privates by putting the officers in two roomsused for offices at the warehouse. I made them as comfortable as Icould, and fed them well. I would turn the officers out every day intothe front porch or vestibule of the warehouse, where they could getfresh air. They were quite a lively lot of fellows, except one old man,Colonel Harrison, I believe, of the Eighth Iowa. They appreciated mykindness and made me quite a number of small presents when the timecame for them to leave.This Newnan affair occurred July 30, 1864. General Hood had apparentlygrown tired of assaulting the lines in our front, and resumed thedefensive. Our duties, until the 18th of August, were about the sameas they had been formerly2014heavy picketing and daily skirmishing. Thecasualties, however, were continually depleting our ranks: the deadwere wrapped in their blankets and buried; the badly wounded sent tothe hospitals in Atlanta, while the slightly wounded were sent offto take care of themselves; in other words, were given an indefinitefurlough to go where they pleased, so that a slight wound became a boongreatly to be prized. Many returned to Mississippi to be cared for bysome friend or acquaintance, while some remained in Georgia.CHAPTER XIVKILPATRICK2019S RAID Kilpatrick2019s Raid2014Attack on Kilpatrick2014Lee2019s Mill2014Lovejoy2019s Station2014The Brigade Demoralized2014I Surrender2014Playing 2019Possum2014I Escape2014The Brigade Reassembles2014Casualties.ON the night of August 18 Ross2019 brigade was bivouacked a short distanceeast of the road leading from Sand Town, on the Chattahoochee River, toFairburn, on the West Point Railroad, eighteen miles west of Atlanta,thence to Jonesboro, on the Macon Railroad, some twenty miles south ofAtlanta. This latter was the only railroad we then had which was of anymaterial value to us, and we knew that General Sherman was anxious todestroy it, as an unsuccessful effort in that direction had been madeonly a few days previous.We had a strong picket on the Sand Town and Fairburn road, and, as allwas quiet in front, we 201Claid us down to sleep,201D and, perchance, todream2014of home, of the independence of the Confederate States, and allthat was most dear to us. It was one of those times of fair promises,to the weary soldier, of a solid night2019s rest, so often and so rudelybroken. Scarcely had we straightened out our weary limbs and foldedour arms to sleep, when we were aroused by the shrill notes of thebugle sounding 201Cboots and saddles.201D Our pickets were being driven inrapidly, and before we were in our saddles General Judson Kilpatrick,with a force of five thousand cavalry, with artillery, ambulances,pack mules and all else that goes to constitute a first-class cavalryraiding force, had passed our flank and was moving steadily down theFairburn road. The Third Texas were directed to move out first and gaintheir front, to be followed by the other regiments of the brigade.For the remainder of the night we moved as best we could down suchroads as we could find parallel to Kilpatrick2019s line of march2014so near,in fact, that we could distinctly hear the clatter of their horses2019hoofs, the rumbling of their artillery, and the familiar rattle ofsabers and canteens. Soon after daylight we came in sight of his columncrossing the railroad at Fairburn, charged into it and cut it in twofor the time. They halted, formed a line of battle, and we detainedthem in skirmishing until we managed to effect our object,2014the gainingtheir front,2014and during the day, until late in the afternoon, detainedthem as much as possible on their march.Below Fairburn Kilpatrick2019s main column took the Jonesboro road, whilea small column took the road leading to Fayetteville, a town about tenmiles west of Jonesboro. Ross2019 brigade, continuing in front of themain column and that of Armstrong, followed the Fayetteville road.Just before night we passed through Jonesboro, which is ten or twelvemiles from Fairburn, and allowed Kilpatrick to occupy the town for thenight. Ross2019 brigade occupied a position south of the town near therailroad, while Armstrong was west; General Ferguson, whose brigadewas numerically stronger than either of the others, being directed togo out on a road leading east. As we afterwards learned, they failedto find their road, or got lost, and, so far as I remember, were notheard from for a day or two. Thus posted, or intended to be posted, theunderstanding and agreement was that we should make a triangular attackon Kilpatrick at daylight the next morning.Our brigade moved on time and marched into the town, only to learnthat, with the exception of a few stragglers who had oversleptthemselves, not a Federal soldier was to be found. The brigade followedthem eastwardly from Jonesboro, and in due time came up with theirrear-guard at breakfast behind some railworks near Lee2019s Mill, and fromthis time until along in the afternoon we had a pretty warm time withtheir rear. They were moving on a road that intersects the McDonoughand Lovejoy road, and when they struck this road they turned in thedirection of Lovejoy Station.We finally came up with the main force ensconced behind some heavyrailworks on a hill near a farmhouse a short distance east of thestation. We had to approach them, after leaving the timber, througha lane probably three-quarters of a mile in length. The farm wasmostly uncultivated, and had been divided into three fields by twocross-fences, built of rails running at right angles with the lane,and these were thrown right and left to admit of the free passage ofcavalry. In the eastern cross fence, however, a length some twenty orthirty yards, and but a few rails high, was left standing, when a ditchor ravine running along on the west side was too deep to be safelycrossed by cavalry. In this lane the command dismounted, leaving thehorses in the hands of holders, and deployed in line in the open field,to the left or south side of the lane, and a section of Croft2019s Georgiabattery was placed on an elevation to the right of the lane.I had been sent back to Lee2019s Mill to hurry up a detail left to buryone of our dead, so was behind when the line was formed. Having, onthe day we fought McCook, picked up a mule for my boy Jake to ride, Inow had him leading my horse to rest his back, while I rode the mule.I rode up and gave my rein to a horse-holder, and was hurrying on tojoin the line when they charged the railworks, and when I got up withthem they had begun to fall back. The brigade, not having more thanfour hundred men for duty, was little more than a skirmish line. Duringthe day General Hood had managed to place General Reynolds2019 Arkansasbrigade at Lovejoy Station, which fact Kilpatrick had discovered,and while we were showing our weakness in an open field on one side,General Reynolds managed to keep his men under cover of timber on theother. Thus Kilpatrick found himself between an unknown infantry forcein front and a skirmish-line of dismounted cavalry and a section ofartillery in his rear. He concluded to get out of this situation2014andhe succeeded. Being repulsed in the charge on the railworks, by aheavy fire of artillery and small arms, we fell back and re-formed ourline behind the first cross fence. Three regiments of the enemy thenrapidly moved out from behind their works, the Fourth United States,Fourth Michigan, and Seventh Pennsylvania, and charged with sabers,in columns of fours, the three columns abreast. As they came on us ata sweeping gallop, with their bright sabers glittering, it was a granddisplay. And Ross2019 brigade was there and then literally run over,trampled under foot, and, apparently annihilated. Just before thecharge they had shelled our horses in the lane, which, consequently,had been moved back into the timber.What could we do under the circumstances? If we had had time to holda council of war and had deliberated over the matter ever so long,we would probably have acted just as we did; that is, acted upon theinstinct of self-preservation, rather than upon judgment. No orderwas heard; not a word spoken; every officer and every man took inthe whole situation at a glance: no one asked or gave advice: no onewaited for orders. The line was maintained intact for a few seconds,the men emptying their pieces at the heads of the columns. Thiscreated a momentary flutter without checking their speed, and on theycame in fine style. There was no time for reloading, and every oneinstinctively started for the horses a mile in the rear, a half mileof open field behind us, and all of us much fatigued with the activeduties performed on the sultry summer day. Being very much fatiguedmyself and never being fleet of foot, I outran only two men in thebrigade, Lieutenant W. H. Carr, of Company C, and W. S. Coleman, ofCompany A, of the Third Texas, who were both captured, and I kept upwith only two others, Captain Noble and Lieutenant Soap, also of theThird Texas. We three came to the ravine already described, at the sameinstant. Soap dropped into it, Noble jumped over and squatted in thesage grass in the corner of the fence. I instantly leaped the ravineand the rail fence, and had gone perhaps ten or fifteen steps when theclatter of horses2019 hoofs became painfully distinct, and 201CSurrender,sir!201D rang in my ear like thunder.Now, I had had no thought of the necessity of surrendering, as I hadfondly hoped and believed I would escape. Halting, I looked up toascertain whether these words were addressed to me, and instantlydiscovered that the column directly in my wake was dividing, two andtwo, to cross the ravine, coming together again just in front of me,so that I was completely surrounded. This _was_ an emergency. As Ilooked up my eyes met those of a stalwart rider as he stood up in hisstirrups, his drawn saber glittering just over my head; and, as Ihesitated, he added in a kind tone: 201CThat2019s all I ask of you, sir.201D Ihad a rifle in my hand which had belonged to one of our men who hadbeen killed near me during the day. Without speaking a word, I droppedthis on the ground in token of my assent. 201CAll right,201D said he, as hespurred his horse to overtake some of the other men.Just at this time our artillery began throwing shells across thecharging columns, and the first one exploded immediately above ourheads, the pieces falling promiscuously around in my neighborhood,creating some consternation in their ranks. Taking advantage of this,I placed my left hand above my hip, as if struck, and fell as long afall as I could towards the center of the little space between thecolumns, imitating as best I could the action of a mortally woundedman,2014carefully falling on my right side to hide my pistol, which Istill had on. Here I lay, as dead to all outward appearances as anysoldier that fell during the war, and remained in this position withoutmoving a muscle, until the field was clear of all of Kilpatrick2019smen who were able to leave it. To play the r00F4le of a dead man for acouple of hours and then make my escape may sound like a joke to theinexperienced, and it was really a practical joke on the raiders;but to me, to lie thus exposed on the bare ground, with a column ofhostile cavalry passing on either side all the time, and so near methat I could distinctly hear any ordinary conversation, was far fromenjoyable. I am no stranger to the hardships of a soldier2019s life; Ihave endured the coldest weather with scant clothing, marched day afterday and night after night without food or sleep; have been exposedto cold, hunger, inclement weather and fatigue until the power ofendurance was well-nigh exhausted, but never did I find anything quiteso tedious and trying as playing dead. I had no idea of time, exceptthat I knew that I had not lain there all night. The first shell ourmen threw after I fell came near killing me, as a large piece plowedup the ground near enough to my back to throw dirt all over me. Theirammunition, however, was soon exhausted, the guns abandoned, and thatdanger at an end.As things grew more quiet the awful fear seized me that my ruse wouldbe discovered and I be abused for my deception, and driven up andcarried to prison. This fear haunted me until the last. Now, to addto the discomfort of my situation, it began to rain, and never in mylife had I felt such a rain. When in my fall I struck the ground myhat had dropped off, and this terrible rain beat down in my face untilthe flesh was sore. But to move an arm or leg, or to turn my face overfor protection was to give my case completely away, and involved,as I felt, the humiliation of a prison life; than which nothing inthe bounds of probability in my life as a Confederate soldier was sohorrible, in which there was but one grain of consolation, and that wasthat I would see my brother and other friends who had been on Johnson2019sIsland for some months.The last danger encountered was when some dismounted men came neardriving some pack mules over me. Finally everything became so quietthat I ventured to raise my head, very slowly and cautiously at first,and as not a man could be seen I finally rose to my feet. Walking up toa wounded Pennsylvania cavalryman I held a short conversation with him.Surveying the now deserted field, so lately the scene of such activity,and supposing as I did that Ross2019 brigade as an organization was brokenup and destroyed, I was much distressed. I was left alone and afoot,and never expected to see my horse or mule any more, which in fact Inever did, as Kilpatrick2019s cavalry, after charging through the field,had turned into the road and stampeded our horses.I now started out over the field in the hope of picking up enoughplunder to fit myself for service in some portion of the army. Inthis I succeeded beyond my expectation, as I found a pretty good,completely rigged horse, only slightly wounded, and a pack-mule withpack intact, and I soon loaded the mule well with saddles, bridles,halters, blankets, and oil cloths. Among other things I picked up aSharp2019s carbine, which I recognized as belonging to a messmate. While Iwas casting about in my mind as to what command I would join, I heardthe brigade bugle sounding the assembly! Sweeter music never was heardby me. Mounting my newly-acquired horse and leading my pack-mule, Iproceeded in the direction from which the bugle notes came, and onthe highest elevation in the field, on the opposite side of the lane,I found General Ross and the bugler. I told my experience, and heardour gallant brigadier2019s laughable story of his escape. I sat on mynew horse and looked over the field as the bugle continued to soundthe assembly occasionally, and was rejoiced to see so many of our menstraggling in from different directions, coming apparently out of theground, some of them bringing up prisoners, one of whom was so drunkthat he didn2019t know he was a prisoner until the next morning.Near night we went into camp with the remnant collected, and the mencontinued coming in during the night and during all the next day. Tosay that we were crestfallen and heartily ashamed of being run overis to put it mildly; but we were not so badly damaged, after all. Thehorse-holders, when the horses stampeded, had turned as many as theycould out of the road and saved them. But as for me, I had sufferedalmost a total loss, including the fine sword that John B. Long hadpresented me at Thompson2019s Station, and which I had tied on my saddle.My faithful Jake came in next morning, and although he could not savemy horse, he had saved himself, his little McCook mule and some of mysoldier clothes. My pack-mule and surplus rigging I now distributedamong those who seemed to need them most.Including officers, we had eighty-four or eighty-five men captured, andonly sixteen or eighteen of these were carried to Northern prisons.Among them were seven officers, including my friend Captain Noble, whowas carried to Johnson2019s Island, and messed with my brother until theclose of the war. Captain Noble had an eye for resemblances. When hefirst saw my brother he walked up to him and said, 201CI never saw youbefore, but I will bet your name is Barron, and I know your brotherwell.201D The other prisoners who escaped that night and returned to usnext day included my friend Lieutenant Soap, who brought in a prisoner,and Luther Grimes, owner of the Sharp2019s carbine, already mentioned, whohad an ugly saber wound in the head. I remember only two men of theThird Texas who were killed during the day2014William Kellum of CompanyC, near Lee2019s Mill; and John Hendricks, of Company B, in the charge onthe railworks. These two men had managed to keep on details from oneto two years, being brought to the front under orders to cut down alldetails to increase the fighting strength, and they were both killed onthe field the first day they were under the enemy2019s fire.Among the wounded was Captain S. S. Johnson, of Company K, Third Texas,gunshot wound, while a number of the men were pretty badly hacked withsabers. Next day General Ross went up to General Hood2019s headquartersand said to him: 201CGeneral, I got my brigade run over yesterday.201DGeneral Hood replied, 201CGeneral Ross, you have lost nothing by that,sir. If others who should have been there had been near enough to theenemy to be run over, your men would not have been run over.201D Thisgreatly relieved our feelings, and the matter became only an incidentof the campaign, and on the 22d day of August Ross2019 brigade was back inits position ready for duty.CHAPTER XVUNION SOLDIER2019S ACCOUNT OF KILPATRICK2019S RAID Kilpatrick2019s Raid2014Ordered to the Front2014Enemy2019s Artillery Silenced2014We Destroy the Railroad2014Hot Work at the Railroad2014Plan of Our Formation2014Stampeding the Horses2014The Enemy Charges2014Sleeping on Horseback2014Swimming the River2014Camped at Last.AFTER the war ended I made a friend of Robert M. Wilson of Illinois,who served in the Fourth United States Cavalry, and he kindly wrote outand sent me his account of this raid, and by way of parenthesis I hereinsert it, as it may be of interest.       *       *       *       *       *201CThe following is an account of the Kilpatrick raid, made inAugust, 1864, written partly from memory and partly from a letterwritten August 28, 1864, by Captain Robert Burns, acting assistantadjutant-general of the First Brigade, Second Cavalry Division, Iacting as orderly for him part of the time on the raid. I was detailedat brigade headquarters as a scout during the Atlanta campaign anduntil General Wilson took our regiment as his escort. On the 17th ofAugust, 1864, at one o2019clock, A. M., ours and Colonel Long2019s Brigade(the First and Second), of Second Cavalry Division, all under thecommand of Colonel Minty, left our camp on Peach Tree Creek, on theleft of our army northeast of Atlanta, at seven o2019clock next morning;reported to General Kilpatrick at Sand Town on the right of our army,having during the night passed from one end or flank of our army tothe other. We remained at Sand Town until sundown of the 18th, when westarted out to cut the enemy2019s communications south of Atlanta. Twoother expeditions, Stoneman2019s and McCook2019s, well equipped, before thishad been ruined in attempting the same thing. We, however, imaginedwe were made of sterner stuff, and started off in good spirits. Thecommand consisted of Third Cavalry Division (Kilpatrick2019s), underColonel Murray, about 2700 men, and two brigades of our division (theSecond), under command of Colonel Minty, about 2700 men also2014the wholecommanded by Kilpatrick (or Kill Cavalry, as we always called him).201CAway we went, Third Division in advance. The night was a beautifulmoonlight one, and we would have enjoyed it more if we had not been upall the night preceding. We did not go more than three miles before weran into the enemy2019s pickets, when we had to go more slowly, drivingthem before us, dismounting to feel the woods on both sides, etc., etc.Consequently it was morning when we reached the Atlanta & West PointRailroad near Fairburn. At Red Oak we had torn up about half a mile ofthe track when the rear battalion of Seventh Pennsylvania Cavalry wassuddenly attacked by a force of dismounted men and artillery. Just backof where our column was struck were the ambulances, the darkies leadingofficers2019 horses, pack-mules, etc., etc. Several shells dropped amongthem, and they thought the kingdom had come, sure. The Fourth UnitedStates Cavalry, being in rear of the ambulances, soon drove the enemyaway. All this time the head of the column kept moving on, as time wasprecious and we could not stop for slight scrimmages.201CGeneral Kilpatrick, not being satisfied with the progress made by hisadvance, ordered our brigades to take the front and Murray the rear.(We had learned before starting that it was expected we, our division,would do all the fighting.) Long2019s brigade, in advance, had not gonemore than half a mile when he found a strong force of the enemy in hisfront. He had to dismount his men to drive the enemy from the railbarricades they had made, but he would find them in the same positionhalf a mile farther on. Long kept his men dismounted, having numberfour lead the horses. I was close up with the advance with ColonelMinty. We drove the enemy steadily but slowly back, until we came tothe valley through which Flint River runs, when they were reinforcedby Ferguson2019s brigade of cavalry (we had been fighting Ross2019 brigadethus far), and opened on us sharply with artillery when we commenceddescending the hill, the shells and bullets rattling lively around us.Two guns of our battery2014we had with us four guns of Chicago Board ofTrade which belonged to our division, and Murray had with him four gunsof the Eleventh Wisconsin Battery2014were soon brought up and succeededin silencing the enemy2019s artillery, the first striking an artillerymanand blowing him to pieces. Our division were then all dismounted andmoved forward at the double-quick under fire of our eight guns, anddrove the enemy clear through Jonesboro, crossing the bridge on thestringer. Our brigade (First) had the advance, being nearly alldeployed as skirmishers. We then seized the railroad for which we hadstarted, and we commenced to smash things generally. The track was tornup for about two miles, the depot and public buildings burned, anddestruction was let loose. While this was going on the enemy returnedto the attack, and our division was sent to meet them, the ThirdDivision turning the rails. The enemy were driven southward and we werepushed that way, to shove them farther back. Before was darkness anddeath, behind the burning buildings and smoking ruins, and now it alsobegan to thunder, lightning, and pour down rain in torrents. All thistime General Kilpatrick had one of his bands behind us playing 2018YankeeDoodle2019 and other patriotic airs. It appeared as if defeat was coming,for we could hear the whistle of the cars in front of us and knew thatthe enemy were being reinforced from below. We then determined to flankthem, so about midnight our brigade, followed by the Third Division,moved in a southeasterly direction about seven miles, Long2019s brigadebeing left to cover the rear.201CWhen seven miles out we stopped to feed, close to 6 A. M., about amile from Murray2019s Division, but were little protected, as both hillswere cleared and the valley had but few trees in it. Our brigade wasordered to mount and move forward when Colonel Long2019s brigade wasattacked by the cavalry that followed us from Jonesboro. The enemy2019sforces consisted of the brigades of Ross, Ferguson, and Armstrong,about 4500 men. Our brigade moved on and turned sharply to the right,in a southwesterly direction, to strike the railroad again about eightmiles below Jonesboro. I stayed on the hill with Captain Burns, for ashort time, to witness the skirmishing between Long and the enemy. Fromwhere we were all our maneuvers could be distinctly seen, as also theenemy, who would advance upon our men, only to be driven back. It wasa beautiful sight. 2018By Heaven, it was a noble sight to see2014by one whohad no friend or brother there.2019201CCaptain Burns, myself following, now galloped off to overtake ourbrigade, which we soon did. Colonel Long had orders to follow asquickly as possible, Colonel Murray to come after. We (our brigade)pushed for Lovejoy Station. When within a mile and a half of therailroad we halted for the rest of the command to join us. About a milefrom the railroad the road forks, the two prongs striking the railroadabout a half a mile apart. A few hundred feet in front of and parallelto the railroad another road ran. The Fourth Michigan was sent by theright-hand road to the railroad, which it reached without any trouble;the rest of the brigade took the left-hand prong of the road, havingfor the last mile or two been driving off about a dozen cavalrymen. Aswe neared the railroad the firing became hotter and hotter. The SeventhPennsylvania Cavalry was dismounted and sent forward to the woods2014onebattalion, four companies, of it had been advance guard. Hotter grewthe firing, and the horses of the advance who had dismounted camehurrying back. The Fourth United States (Regulars) were then dismountedand sent in. Captain Burns was sent back to hurry up two of Long2019sregiments, but before this could be done the Seventh Pennsylvaniaand Fourth Regulars were driven from the woods in some confusion. Wehad run on a brigade of infantry who were lying in the woods behindbarricades at the side of the railroad, and a force of the enemy wasalso pushed in on the right, where the Fourth Michigan were at work.Long2019s brigade was put in position to check the advancing Confederates,and our battery brought up, as the woods in front and on our leftwere swarming with the enemy, and the Fourth Regulars and SeventhPennsylvania were placed in support of the battery. Poor fellows, theywere badly cut up!201COne of Long2019s regiments was formed near the fork of the road, theFourth Michigan was being placed there, and the enemy tried againand again to take our battery. It fought magnificently, and the gunswere made to radiate in all directions and did splendid work, our mensupporting them well. One of the guns, by the rebound, had broken itstrail off short, so that it could not be drawn from the field. When therest of the pieces had been withdrawn Colonel Minty called for men todraw off the piece by hand. Captain Burns took about twenty men of theFourth Michigan Cavalry down and helped pull it off, though the enemywere very close to us. While this was taking place, heavy firing washeard in our rear, for the cavalry with which we had been fighting hadfollowed us, and had us in a pretty tight box, as follows: a brigade ofinfantry in our front and partly on our left; a division moving on ourright and but a short distance off; three brigades of cavalry in ourrear. Stoneman and McCook threw up the sponge under like circumstances.We decided we must leave the railroad alone, and crush the enemy2019scavalry, and consequently withdrew from fighting the infantry, who nowbecame very quiet, probably expecting to soon take us all in.201CThe command was faced to the rear as follows: Our brigade was formedon the right hand side of the road, each regiment in columns of fours(four men abreast); the Fourth Regulars on the left; Fourth Michigancenter; Seventh Pennsylvania on the right, Long2019s brigade formed inclose columns with regimental front, that is, each regiment formed inline, the men side by side, boot to boot, thus:  MINTY2019S BRIGADE  FOURTH    FOURTH    SEVENTH   U. S.     MICH.

You see,we were to break through the enemy, smashing them, and Long was tosweep over the ground and pick them up. This was soon determined on,for there was no time to lose. A few of our men were in front of us,dismounted, skirmishing with the enemy, and they were told to throwdown the fence where they were. The enemy all this time was keepingthem engaged as much as possible, while a large force of them werebuilding rail barricades. We were formed just below the brow of thehill, skirmishers on the crest of it, the enemy2019s artillery to our leftand front playing over us, and bullets and shells flying thick over ourheads. We drew saber, trotted until we came to the crest of the hilland then started at a gallop. Down the hill we went, the enemy turningcanister upon us, while the bullets whistled fiercely, and the batteryaway on our right threw shells. We leaped fences, ditches, barricades,and were among them, the artillery being very hot at this time. Youcould almost feel the balls as they passed by. The Fourth Michigan andSeventh Pennsylvania went straight forward to the woods, the field overwhich they passed being at least a half a mile wide, with three fences,one partially built barricade, and a number of ditches and gullies,some very wide and deep. Of course many of the men were dismounted, andupon reaching the woods they (our men) could not move fast, and theyturned to the right and joined the main column in the road about oneand a half miles from the start. The Fourth Regulars (my regiment, asI joined it when the charge was ordered) could not keep parallel withthe rest of the brigade on account of high fences in our front, andseeing an opening in the fence we turned to the left, and struck out onthe main road, coming upon the enemy in the road near their battery,and sending them flying. We were soon among the led horses of thedismounted men in their rear and among the ambulances, and a perfectstampede took place, riderless horses and ambulances being scattered inall directions, we in the midst of them, shooting and cutting madly.A part of our regiment, with some of the Fourth Michigan and SeventhPennsylvania, dashed at the battery, drove the men from the pieces, andcaptured three of the guns. Private William Bailey, a young Tennesseanfrom near McMinnville, who belonged to Fourth Michigan Cavalry (he wasassociated with me at headquarters as scout), shot the captain. Webrought away the guns, and the charge continued for about two miles,when we halted for the command to close up. Colonel Long2019s brigade didnot charge in line as it was intended, for, finding that the ground wasimpracticable, it formed in column and followed the Fourth Regulars.Colonel Murray2019s command, instead of sweeping all to the left, as wesupposed they would do, turned to the right and followed Long. HadMurray done what was expected, both sides of the road would have beencleaned out.201CImmediately after the charge and while we were pushing through thewoods it commenced to rain, and poured in torrents. The command wasnow started for McDonough, but before the whole of it had moved off,Long2019s brigade, which had been moved to cover the rear, was fiercelyattacked by the infantry of the enemy. Colonel Long fought them forabout two hours, when, his ammunition giving out, he was obliged toretire. (Here Long was wounded twice.) The Fourth Michigan and SeventhPennsylvania were formed in the rear, Long behind rail barricades whichhad been hastily thrown up. The Fourth United States Regulars beingout of ammunition were sent on to McDonough, where the Ninety-secondIllinois Mounted Infantry divided ammunition with some of us near thistown. One of Long2019s regiments assisted the Fourth Michigan and SeventhPennsylvania. Long passed his men through when the enemy came on us.Then we had it hot and heavy, the enemy charging several times, butwere repulsed. All this fighting here was done dismounted, and was forthe purpose of holding back the enemy until our main column could getout of the way. Our battery (three pieces) during this fight burstone gun and wedged another, getting a shell part way down it, so itcould not be moved either way, so we had one gun only, but that wasused with effect, the enemy meanwhile playing their artillery into ourcolumns all along the road. You see our two brigades had to do all thefighting, lead the charge, and cover the retreat. As soon as our menhad passed on about a mile, our rear-guard followed, and we were notmolested again. We pushed slowly on to McDonough, crossed Walnut Creek,and near morning lay down in the mud for sleep. How tired we were Icannot tell, and men would tumble prone from their horses, and it wasnext to impossible to awaken them. Frequently two or three men wouldfall asleep upon their horses, who would stop, and the whole columnbehind them would naturally do the same, too, supposing that therewas obstruction ahead. Hundreds of men were sometimes asleep in thatway upon their horses in the mud for an hour or so at a time. Duringthis time I fell asleep for about two hours, and awoke drenched to theskin, for it was raining, and fearfully dark and very disagreeable.About two o2019clock we found a place to stop. I never before that knewwhat fatigue meant, for I had not slept a wink for the nights of the17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th until the morning (about 2 A. M.) of the21st, except what I had when riding along. We had had but three meals,and but little time to eat them, had fought seven pretty hard fights,besides skirmishing, etc., etc. At daybreak the next morning we startedon again. At Cotton River the bridge was gone, the stream much swollenby rain, so that it could not be forded and the horses were obliged toswim it. As the current was very swift, we had a terrible time crossingit. We, our brigade, lost one man and about sixty horses drowned here,and nearly all our pack-mules also. We could not get the wagon with thetwo disabled guns across at all, and rumor said they were buried here,and the site marked as the graves of two soldiers of the Fourth UnitedStates Cavalry. It was terrible to see the poor wounded carried across,some fastened on horses, while others were taken over in ambulances.We all finally got over, but if the enemy had pushed us here most ofthe command would have been captured. We were now nearly all out ofammunition, and many an anxious glance I gave to the rear, it being arelief when all were over. We then crossed South River bridge, burningall the bridges for ten miles each side, and camped that night atLithonia. The next day we returned to our camp at Peach Tree Creek,having made a complete circuit of the two armies of Hood and Sherman.We did not do all we hoped we could when we started, but _we did all wecould_. Notwithstanding what we had suffered, General Sherman was muchdissatisfied with us, expecting more from us than lay in our power (orhis either) to accomplish.[Illustration: G. A. MCKEEPrivate Company C, Third Texas Cavalry]201CIn the above narrative I have drawn very largely from a letter writtenAugust 28, 1864, by Captain Burns (as stated before), printed in awork called 2018Minty and the Cavalry,2019 though about all I have writtenoccurred under my own observation. We captured three stands of colorsclaimed to belong to the Third Texas Cavalry,[4] Zachariah Rangers, andBenjamin2019s Infantry. 201COur aggregate loss in First and Second Brigades, killed, wounded, and missing, was 14 officers, 192 men.201D[5]  201CROBERT M. WILSON,  201CCompany M, Fourth United States Cavalry.201DCHAPTER XVICLOSE OF THE ATLANTA CAMPAIGN Sherman Changes His Tactics2014Hood Deceived2014Heavy Fighting2014Atlanta Surrenders2014End of the Campaign2014Losses2014Scouting2014An Invader2019s Devastation2014Raiding the Raiders2014Hood Crosses the Coosa2014A Reconnoissance2014Negro Spies2014Raiding the Blacks2014Crossing Indian Creek2014A Conversion.GENERAL SHERMAN had been impatient and dissatisfied that his cavalrywas unable to destroy the Macon or Brunswick Railroad, and now changedhis tactics. He had been in front of Atlanta, since General Hood hadbeen in command, a period of about five weeks. In a few days afterKilpatrick2019s return, he began withdrawing his forces from the front ofthat beleaguered city, crossed to the north side of the Chattahoochee,marched his main force down to Sand Town, recrossed the river, andmoved directly on Jonesboro, some twenty miles below Atlanta.I do not believe, and never have believed, that General Hood understoodthis maneuver until it was too late to save even his stores, arms,and ammunition in Atlanta. His infantry scouts, it was understood andbelieved at the time, watched the enemy2019s movements, to the point oftheir crossing to the north side of the Chattahoochee, and reportedthat they were retreating, while our cavalry scouts reported that theywere recrossing at Sand Town, in heavy force in our front.We, that is, our cavalry, began fighting the head of their columnas soon as they crossed the river, and fought them for detention anddelay, as best we could, all the way to the Flint River Crossingnear Jonesboro, just as we had fought Kilpatrick2019s force a few daysbefore. General Hood, being advised that a heavy force of infantryand artillery was moving on Jonesboro, sent a portion of his armydown there, and they fought the enemy most gallantly, but it seemedto me that our army should have been in their front long before theycrossed Flint River. As it was, General Sherman threw his army acrossthe railroad, on the first day of September, between us and Atlanta,and, while the fighting was terrific, we were unable to drive themoff. A terrible battle, in which there were no breastworks, was foughtlate in the evening, and General Cleburne2019s division was cut in two,for the first time during the war, when General Govan of his divisionwas captured and Colonel Govan killed. We were in line, dismounted,just on General Cleburne2019s right, forming a mere skirmish line, inorder to cover the enemy2019s front. The welcome shades of night soongathered around us, and the fighting ceased when the opposing lineswere almost together. I was on picket two or three hundred yards backof the enemy2019s line until one or two o2019clock in the morning. Allthis time they were felling timber and strengthening their positionfor the fighting they expected in the morning. During the eveningLieutenant-Colonel Berry of the Ninth Texas Cavalry was killed.Soon after midnight a courier from General Hood passed us and informedus that Atlanta was given up. As soon as he reached our headquartersa courier was sent to order us to fall back. And thus ended thelast battle of the long campaign about Atlanta, a campaign involvingcontinuous fighting for three and a half months.Very soon after General Hood2019s courier passed us we began to hearthe artillery ammunition exploding in Atlanta. All was burned thatcould not be carried away on the march, as we now had no railroadtransportation. After burning the arms, ammunition, and stores thatcould not be transported, General Hood moved out with his army, andthe Federals took undisputed possession of the city the next day.General Hood, after burning his supplies, had moved out during thenight eastwardly and by a circuitous march joined his other forcesnear Lovejoy Station. General Sherman soon abandoned Jonesboro, movedhis army into and around Atlanta and two tired armies rested. Shermanreported his loss in this campaign at 34,514, quite a large army initself.Our army settled down for the time being near Jonesboro, Ross2019 brigadedoing outpost duty. The ranks of the brigade had become very muchdepleted by the losses in killed, wounded, and captured during theAtlanta campaign, and the companies were temporarily consolidated. Thiscaused the regiments of the brigade, except the Third Texas, to haveon hand a number of supernumerary company officers. The Third havingmore officers in prisons and hospitals than the others, only had aboutenough officers after consolidation. These officers, with consent ofthe commanders, agreed to organize themselves into a scouting party. Ihad permission to join them, and as this offered some recreation, orat least a diversion, I did so, being the only member from the Third.They were all gallant and experienced officers and jovial companionablefellows.We organized by selecting Captain H. W. Wade of the Sixth Texascommander. I cannot now recall all of them, but among them wereCaptains O. P. Preston, Reuben Simpson, Cook, and Broughton, andLieutenants W. J. Swain, Thompson Morris, W. W. McClathie, Bridges,and Park. We were joined by the gallant Captain Reams, of Missouri,whose command had surrendered at the fall of Vicksburg, and who, havinggone to Missouri to recruit his command, was captured and imprisoned,but had escaped into Canada, and from there made his way back toGeneral Hood2019s army. We were sent on duty in the country lying northof the West Point Railroad and south of the Chattahoochee River, westand northwest of Atlanta2014this being a large scope of country notoccupied by either army and liable to be depredated upon by the enemy.Campbellton, the county seat of Campbell County, was a town of someimportance situated on the south bank of the Chattahoochee River, somethirty miles northwestwardly from Atlanta. The Federal outpost in thisdirection was twelve or fifteen miles out from the city.Our duties were performed for several weeks without incident worthy ofmention. We were sometimes in the territory over which we had foughtduring the summer, and a more desolate country I never saw; not adomestic animal or fowl, and scarcely a bird, could be seen; the woods,where we had fed our horses shelled corn, had grown up in green cornmore than knee high, and there were no animals to crop it down; thefences had all been torn down to build barricades, and the crops hadbeen without cultivation or protection since the early summer; the cornhad made small ears and the sorghum had grown up into little triflingstalks, and the people who lived hereabouts were subsisting on cornbread made of grated meal and syrup made in the crudest manner. Oh, thedevastation and horrors of war! They must be seen to be realized.One morning we met Lieutenant Bob Lee, with his scouts, and it wasagreed that we would spend the day together on a trip towards the riverbetween Campbellton and Sherman2019s outpost. Bob Lee was a fine scout, amember of the Ninth Texas Cavalry who had been promoted from the ranksto first lieutenant for his efficiency. Lee2019s scouts numbered twenty,while we numbered twenty-one, all well armed with Colt2019s revolvers andwell mounted. On our way we picked up Pem Jarvis, of Company K, ThirdTexas, who was glad to join us. Pem had the only gun in the company,and no pistol.We moved north by any road or trail found to lead to the rightdirection, until about noon, when we struck the rear of a farm lyingin a little valley. Along the opposite ridge ran the 201Cridge road201D fromAtlanta to Campbellton, probably half a mile distant. Near the road,in a strip of timber, stood a farmhouse. Near the house we heard a gunfire and a hog squeal. Throwing down the fence we rode in and movedacross cautiously, so as not to be seen from the house. Passing outthrough a pair of draw-bars, three or four of the men galloped up tothe house and into the yard, where they found two Federal soldiers inthe act of dressing a hog they had just killed. From them we learnedthat a party of about sixty cavalrymen, in charge of an officer, andhaving with them two four-mule wagons, had just passed, going in thedirection of Campbellton. We started off, leaving the hog killers incharge of two of our men, and filed into the road. At the first houseon the road, supposed to be Dr. Hornsby2019s, two ladies were in the actof mounting their horses at the gate. They were crying, and told usthat some Yankee soldiers had passed there and insulted them, and thatthey were going to headquarters to ask for protection. They estimatedthe number at about sixty, with two wagons. This was about five milesfrom Campbellton.We sent two of our scouts ahead to look for them, as there is alsoa road from Campbellton to Atlanta called the river road. If theyreturned by the ridge road we would meet them, if by the river road wewould miss them. The scouts were to ascertain this matter and report.We moved on to within about two miles of the town and formed a line inthe brush, a few steps south of the road and parallel with it, where,with bridles and pistols well in hand, we patiently waited the returnof our scouts. The road from our position, towards town as far as wecould see it, ran on a rough down grade and was lined with thick blackjack brush. From here it was impossible for a horseman to get into theriver road without going into town. The intention was, if they came ourway, to wait until their column came up in our front and charge them inflank.In due time we heard our scouts coming at a gallop, and looking upwe saw they were being pursued by two Federals. One of the Federalsreined up and stopped before he got in our front, while the other rodealong nearly the entire front of our line, fired his gun at our scouts,cussed the d20142014d rebels, then stopped, and stood as if waiting for thecolumn, which was then slowly moving up the hill. We could hear themdriving milch cows, which they had taken from citizens, and accompaniedby wagons loaded with the fruits of their day2019s robbery, such astobacco, chickens, and turkeys. The fellow in our front furnishedsuch a tempting target that one of our men fired, and the Federaldropped from his horse. This was sufficient to spoil the ambush, andwe instantly spurred our horses into the road, gave a loud yell, andcharged at full speed down the rough road, into the head of theircolumn. As we approached them they seemed almost to forget the use oftheir seven-shooting rifles in an effort to reverse their column, andbefore they could accomplish this we were in among them, and they ranfor dear life back to gain the river road. We went along with them totown, and they fired back at us vigorously, and powder burned someof our men in the face, but no one of our men received as much as ascratch. We were better armed for such a contest than they were, forthough they had good rifles, their pistols were few, while we carriedfrom two to four Colt2019s revolvers apiece.Jarvis2019 horse became unmanageable in the excitement and ran under someblack jack, and knocked Jarvis2019 gun out of his hand and plunged inamong the enemy, passing by several of them while Jarvis had nothingto defend himself with. Some of them were in the act of shooting himin the back, but invariably Bob Lee or someone else would save him byshooting his assailant in the back of the head. The foremost and bestmounted men, about twenty in number, with one wagon, got through thetown. We followed them a few hundred yards and turned back. We hadtwelve prisoners unhurt, and going back over the road we found fourteendead and fifteen wounded. We had in our possession one wagon and team,thirty or forty rifles, a few pistols, and a number of horses withtheir rigging.As I was going back on the road I came to an elderly wounded man justoutside of the road. I reined up my horse, and as I did so he reachedout a trembling hand, in which he held a greasy leather pocketbook, andsaid: 201CHere, take this, but please don2019t kill me.201D I told him to putup his pocketbook; that I would neither take that nor his life; that Ionly wanted his arms.The slightly wounded men, who would likely be able to fight againvery soon, we put into the wagon, and mounting the unhurt ones on thecaptured horses we paired off with them, and thus started for our ownlines. I rode with one of the prisoners, who was quite a talkativefellow. Upon asking him why it was that so many of their men refused tosurrender, and allowed themselves to be shot, he said: 201COur officershave told us that Ross2019s brigade never shows prisoners any quarter, butwill rob and murder them; and we knew it was Ross2019s brigade as soonas you yelled that way.201D I told him that was a great slander on thebrigade; that no men would treat prisoners more kindly; that sometimeswe were hard up for clothes and would take an overcoat, or blanket, orsomething of the kind from a fellow that was well supplied. 201COh,201D saidhe, 201Cthat2019s nothing; _we_ do that.201D I then said to him: 201CI believe yourboots will fit me, and these brogans of mine will do you just as wellat Andersonville.201D He said, 201CAll right,201D and instantly he dismountedand pulled his boots off. We traded, and I had a good pair of kip bootsthat fit me, and he had brogan shoes, and was apparently happy. Heasked me how it was that we were so much better mounted than they were.I explained that we furnished our own horses, and we must keep them orgo to the infantry, and that made our men good horsemasters; while theUnited States Government furnished them with horses and they knew thatwhen they rode one to death they would get another.We continued our scouting duties in the same section of country untilthe early days of October, when General Hood moved around in GeneralSherman2019s rear, and began destroying his communications, capturingsupplies and provisions. Sherman moved out of Atlanta and followed Hooduntil the latter came to the vicinity of Rome. General Hood unwillingto risk a battle in the open field, crossed the Coosa River, movingby way of Gadsden, Ala., towards Guntersville on the Tennessee River.When General Sherman discovered this movement he turned back towardsAtlanta, devastating the country and despoiling the citizens as he went.With General Hood2019s movement across the Coosa River he began his lastcampaign, and the last campaign for the Army of the Tennessee. Hisintention was to cross the Tennessee at Guntersville and march onNashville, but he changed his mind and moved down the river to nearDecatur, Tuscumbia, and Florence, Ross2019s brigade being in front ofDecatur, then occupied by the Federals. General Sherman returning toAtlanta, that city was burned, and leaving the smoking ruins behindhim, he entered upon his grand march to the sea, with none of GeneralHood2019s army, save General Wheeler2019s cavalry, to molest him in his workof devastation.A day or two after we got to Decatur General Ross ordered our scoutingparty back up the river to ascertain, if we could, what the enemy wasdoing in the rear of that place. We moved up on the south side of theriver and stopped between Triana and Whitesburg. These towns weregarrisoned and the river patrolled by gunboats. We remained in thisneighborhood without any further instructions for some weeks. Here Ifound my half-brother, J. J. Ashworth, who lived on the south bank ofthe river about fifteen miles from Huntsville, and about three milesabove Triana. In this neighborhood were a number of my acquaintancesfrom Madison County, refugeeing, as Huntsville, Brownsboro, andother towns were also garrisoned by the enemy. Several of us crossedthe river afoot and remained some days in Madison County. But forthe negroes we could have had a pleasant time, as every negro inthe country was a spy who would run to report anything that lookedsuspicious to them, to one of the near-by garrisons, so we dared notallow them to see us. I knew the white people, and knew that they wereloyal to our cause, but they could not allow their own negroes to knowthat they did anything for us, so that we, and they, too, had to beexceedingly careful.In crossing the river we had to watch for gunboats, make the passageduring the night in a canoe, which must be drawn out and hidden, elsethe first passing gunboat would destroy it. Some three miles northof the river, in the bottom, lived Alexander Penland, a Presbyterianminister, a true and loyal friend to the Confederacy, and three or fourmiles further on, towards Huntsville, lived William Lanier, BurwellLanier and William Matkins, the two latter on the Huntsville and Trianaroad. Dr. William Leftwich also lived in the same neighborhood. Allwere good, trustworthy men, whom I knew well. Since some of them hadtaken the non-combatant2019s oath they were allowed to go in and outof town at will, and from them I could learn of any movements alongthe M. & C. Railroad. We crossed the river after night, and beingin possession of Mr. Penland2019s countersign, we found our way to hishouse, late at night, after the household was all asleep. I went to acertain front window, tapped lightly and whistled like a partridge.Soon Mr. Penland thrust his head out and in a whisper inquired whowe were and what was wanted. I explained to him briefly, and retiredto a brush thicket near by, where early next morning he brought uscooked provisions. In order to do this he had to get up and cook forus himself before any of his negroes were awake. The next night weslept in William Lanier2019s farm and were fed by him in the same way.We crossed the Triana road and went to the top of a small mountain,from which we could see Huntsville. A rainy season set in and we foundshelter in Burwell Lanier2019s gin-house, where he fed us. When we thoughtof recrossing the Tennessee we found that Indian Creek, which we hadto cross, was outrageously high, spreading away out over the bottom.We spent a good part of an afternoon in constructing a raft by tyinglogs together with vines to enable us to cross that night. Just eastof William Lanier2019s farm there was a large negro quarter, where idleand vicious negroes were in the habit of congregating, and inasmuch astheir system of espionage upon the white people of the neighborhood wasvery annoying, upon the suggestion of some of our friends we determinedto raid this place before we left, carry off some of these meddlesomeblacks and send them to some government works in south Alabama.Accordingly after dark we visited the quarter under the guise ofrecruiting officers from Whitesburg, told them we had been fightingfor their freedom for about three years, and the time had now come forthem to help us, and we had come for every able-bodied man to go withus to Whitesburg and join the army. I had our men call me Brown, forfear some of them might know me. It was laughable to hear the variousexcuses rendered for not going into the service. A lot of Confederateconscripts could not have thought up more physical ailments. We finallygathered up six that we decided were able for service, promising theyshould have a medical examination, and if they were really unfit forservice they would be excused. Among them was a powerful, large,muscular black fellow that belonged to Jink Jordan. He had joined thearmy and, tiring of his job, was now a deserter, and we could see thathe was greatly scared and very much opposed to going with us.Upon leaving the negro houses we went through the field and the woodsdirectly to our raft on the creek and had a great time getting across.The clouds were thick, it was intensely dark, and our means of crossingvery poor. We had to make a number of trips, as we could only floatthree or four men, including the two that used the poles, at one time.In the confusion and darkness two of the prisoners had escaped, andtwo had just crossed, including the big deserter, when it became myduty to guard them with a short Enfield rifle belonging to one of themen. Having their hands tied with a cord and then tied together back toback, I was not uneasy about keeping them, but before I realized whatthey were doing they had slipped their hands through the cord and wererunning through the brush. When the big deserter had gone some twelveor fifteen steps I shot him. He fell at the fire of the gun, but beforeI could get to him he scrambled up and went crashing through the brushlike a stampeding ox. I learned afterwards that he went into Huntsvilleto a hospital for treatment, and that the ball had gone through themuscle of his arm and plowed into his breast, but not deep enough tobe fatal. We finally reached the bank of the river about one or twoo2019clock in the morning, with two of our prisoners. We then had to hootlike an owl until some one on the other side should wake up, and,hearing the signal, would bring us a canoe, which was finally done, andwe crossed over in safety.We crossed the river several times during our stay in the neighborhood,particularly one very cold night, when several of us passed over, atthe request of Mr. Penland, to transfer his pork to the south side. Hehad killed a lot of hogs, and was afraid the meat might be taken fromhim, or that he would be ordered out of the Federal lines as othershad been, and he wished to place it in the hands of a friend south ofthe river for safety. We managed to get an old rickety canoe oppositehis place, and crossed early in the night, and again played the r00F4leof Federal soldiers, as no one on his place but himself must know ourreal mission. Mrs. Penland had known me from childhood, but as she hadlost her mind I did not fear recognition, and while Nancy, their negrowoman, also had known me, she failed to recognize me, as I was Mr.Brown of the Federal army. We marched up and called for the man of thehouse, and when Mr. Penland came forward we told him we were rathershort of rations down in Triana, and were out looking for meat, andwished to know if he had any. He acknowledged that he had just killedsome meat, but only enough for his family use, and had none to spare.We were bound to have meat, and agreed to leave him one hog, and thenyoked up a pair of oxen and hitched them to a wagon. While we were inthe smokehouse preparing to take the meat out, Mr. Penland2019s two littlegirls, about nine and eleven, came crying around us, and in a mostpitiful manner begged us not to take all of papa2019s meat; and poor Mrs.Penland came to the door and said: 201CMen, please don2019t take my littleboy2019s pony.201D When we had hauled all the meat to the river bank andreturned the wagon, it was nearly midnight, and we compelled the womanNancy to get up and prepare us a warm supper. After supper we returnedto the river and floated the hogs across in our old canoe.At this time my brother2019s son, George Ashworth, a gallant boy aboutsixteen years old, who had taken his father2019s place in General Roddy2019scommand, was at home on furlough. One day a thief, believed to bea straggler from General Wheeler2019s command, took his horse from alot some distance from the house, and carried him off. LieutenantMcClatchie and myself mounted a pony and a mule of my brother2019s andattempted to overtake him. We followed him as far as Atlanta, butfailed to catch him, and then went into the city and viewed the wreckthat Sherman had left behind him: thirty-six hundred houses were inruins, including the best part of the city. This was Saturday, andbeing tired we went down to the neighborhood of Jonesboro and remainedwith some of McClatchie2019s acquaintances until Monday morning. We werehospitably entertained at the home of Colonel Tidwell, and enjoyed aquiet rest in the company of Miss Mattie Tidwell and Miss Eva Camp.One evening we passed through the town of Cave Springs, a locality withwhich I had become familiar while we were campaigning here. On the roadwe were to travel, at the first house after leaving town, two or threemiles out, there lived a tall dignified old gentleman and his handsomeyoung married daughter whose husband was in the army. They lived ina large two-story house, and a large commodious barn, with all othernecessary out houses for comfort and convenience, had stood on hispremises when I was there before2014the barn filled to overflowing withwheat, oats, and corn. Just across the road in front of the house, andstretching across the valley, was his large productive farm, coveredwith a heavy crop of ungathered corn. While this was the condition, Ihad come to this house at night, traveling in the same direction, andtalked myself almost hoarse without being able to procure from this oldgentleman a single ear of corn for my horse or a morsel of food formyself, although he knew I must go eight miles to the next house on theroad. I didn2019t ask, nor did I wish, to enter his house, but only wanteda feed of corn and a little bread and meat. As we approached the houseMcClatchie proposed halting, to stay all night2014provided we could. Irelated my earlier experience, but we stopped nevertheless.Upon seeing us halt, the old gentleman came stepping down to the gateand spoke very kindly, and we asked him if we could spend the nightwith him. He said such accommodations as he could offer us we would bewelcome to, adding: 201CI have no stables for your horses. Sherman2019s armypassed this way and burned my barn, with its contents, my stables, andin fact carried off or destroyed everything I had to eat or feed on,and left me and my daughter without a mouthful of anything to eat. Theycarried every hog, every fowl, and every pound of meat, and even rolledmy syrup out of the cellar, knocked the heads out of the barrels andpoured the syrup out on the ground, but I will do the best I can foryou.201D His daughter, too, was very hospitable. At the supper tableshe detailed all the horrors of Sherman2019s visit, and the distressfulcondition they were left in, how they had to go to a neighbor2019s toborrow a few ears of corn to grate them for bread, and concluded bysaying: 201CBut as long as I have a piece of bread I will divide it witha Confederate soldier.201D After supper she invited us into the parlor,where she had a nice piano and treated us to music. Verily 201Courfriends, the enemy,201D had converted one family!CHAPTER XVIIMY LAST BATTLE Tories and Deserters2014A Tragic Story2014A Brutal Murder2014The Son2019s Vow2014Vengeance2014A Southern Heroine2014Seeking Our Command2014Huntsville2014A Strange Meeting2014We Find the Division2014The Battle in the Fog2014My Last Battle.HADEN PRYOR, who lived eight miles west on the same road, was awhole-souled, big-hearted old gentleman, who also had a large placeand plenty of everything to live on, and whose hospitality towardsa Confederate soldier was unbounded. His boys were in the army inVirginia, and he and his wife were at home alone. I had stayed with himwhile hunting a blacksmith shop, and found that a tired Confederatesoldier was more than welcome to his home. Lonely, and impatient forthe war to close, that his gallant boys might come home, he wouldsit out on his front veranda and play solitaire, and was glad to seea soldier come, and sorry to see him leave. He had a nephew in ourregiment that I knew and liked, and I had fallen in love with this oldgentleman. Next morning McClatchie and I, when we came to his house,called to pay him our respects and to tell him good-by.This neighborhood, or rather the neighborhood just south of this, and aconsiderable scope of country lying along the western border of Georgiaand the eastern border of Alabama, was infested with a class of themeanest white men on earth2014Tories and deserters, men too cowardly tofight in either army, but mean and unscrupulous enough to do anything.We knew they were there, but while our army was in the neighborhoodthey were never seen. Since the armies had left they were growingbolder, and we were told at Mr. Pryor2019s that morning about some oftheir thievery and robbery. Providence protected us that day. Here weretwo roads, one to the left and one to the right, and we could followone or the other and reach our destination in the same number of miles.The matter was left to me, and, without thinking of danger, I selectedthe right-hand road. On that day the left-hand road was waylaid by aband of these infamous characters and every Confederate soldier whoattempted to pass the road was robbed of horse, arms, and everythingof any value, and one or two of them murdered. These soldiers had beenleft behind slightly wounded or sick, and were on their way to overtaketheir commands. One of the murdered ones belonged to Ross2019s brigade.       *       *       *       *       *Since the war I have heard, from a reliable source, a tragic story ofthis Pryor family, which, if told in detail, would sound like fiction.It seems that in the spring of 1865 a band of these cut-throats, eightin number, rode up to Haden Pryor2019s gate and without provocation shothim while he was standing in his front yard in presence of his wife;as he turned and was in the act of returning to his house he fell inhis front veranda, a corpse. This was a few days after General Lee2019ssurrender. His oldest son, John, and a younger one, with eight or tenother Confederates, on their way home that night came within eight orten miles of their homes, when, tired and footsore, they lay down torest until morning.John Pryor, haunted by a strange presentiment, could not sleep, anddetermined he would quietly leave the camp and go on to his father2019shouse. While he was dressing one of the others woke and said: 201CHello,John, what are you up to?201D 201CI am going home,201D said John. 201CWait aminute,201D said the other, 201Cand I2019ll go too.201D From that one by one theyall roused up and were soon on the road again. Arriving at home, JohnPryor found his father a bloody corpse and his mother a widow. Hismother told him how it all happened, and gave him the names of hisfather2019s murderers. The next day the funeral took place, and the noblefather who had so patiently waited and longed for the return of hissoldier boys was laid under the sod.Over his father2019s grave John Pryor made a vow that he would not engagein any business whatever as long as one of his father2019s murderers wasalive, and starting out upon his fixed purpose he killed one or two ofthem before the gang became alarmed. The rest now became panic-strickenand fled the country, hiding in different States. John hunted themconstantly and relentlessly for weeks and months, until the weeks grewinto years, and as he found them they were sent to their final account,one by one, until finally he found the last and least guilty one inTravis County, Texas, a few miles from Austin. It was in the spring ofthe year, and the man was plowing when John walked into the field wherehe was. Seeing John coming and recognizing him, he stopped his horseand, waiting until he was within a few steps of him, he said, 201CJohn,I know what you have come for; but I will ask you to let me go to thehouse and tell my wife and children good-by.201D John consented, and theywent to the house, where were the innocent wife and two small childrenin a comfortable little home. The husband and father then said: 201CJohn,I never hurt your father; I didn2019t want those fellows to kill him, andtold them not to do it.201D 201CI remember that my mother told me somethingabout this,201D replied John, 201Cand said you were the only one who said aword against the murder of my father; and now I will retract my vow asto you, and leave you with your wife and children.201DNow feeling that he had fulfilled his mission, Pryor returned to hishome, and devoting his attention to business became a prosperous andsuccessful man.       *       *       *       *       *As we continued our way back to north Alabama, crossing Black Creek, wecame to the residence of Mrs. Sansom. Here we stopped under pretense oflighting our pipes, and remained for an hour, merely to get a look atthe young heroine, Miss Emily Sansom, the young girl who rode behindGeneral Forrest and piloted him to a ford on the creek where he wasin hot pursuit of Colonel Straight and his men. This story of EmilySansom2019s heroism has been published so often that most people arefamiliar with it. She now lives, a widow, in Upshur County, Texas.[6]We pushed on to our former headquarters on the Tennessee River, to findthat our people had been gone ever so long. General Hood had crossedthe river about the last of November, Decatur, Huntsville, Triana, andWhitesburg had all been evacuated by the enemy, and our army was inmiddle Tennessee. Our scouts, as we afterwards learned, had crossedthe river, passed through Huntsville and moved up to the vicinityof Shelbyville. Our command had participated in the fighting on theadvance into Tennessee, had been in the battle of Franklin, and wasthen sent to Murfreesboro.McClatchie and myself crossed the river and spent the night at thehome of our friend, Rev. Alexander Penland. Next day we went intoHuntsville, and while waiting for our horses to be shod I had time tosee a number of my friends, among them Miss Aggie Scott, from whom Ilearned that my old friend, W. H. Powers, and his wife, were sojourningin New London, Conn. We went out in the evening and spent the nightat the home of Mr. William Matkin, a few miles down the Triana road.Late at night Rev. Lieutenant-Colonel William D. Chadick came to Mr.Matkin2019s, afoot, tired and somewhat excited, and informed us that adivision of Federal cavalry had entered Huntsville that afternoon. Hehad been at home with his family, and told an interesting story ofhis escape. He had left his home, gone across lots, and reaching theFemale seminary lot, had hidden under the floor of the seminary untilnightfall, when he had made his way through back lots and fields untilhe was well out of town. He then found his way around to the Trianaroad and here he was.General McCook was in command of the forces that had come in sounexpectedly, and learning that Colonel Chadick was at home, showedgreat anxiety to capture him, so much so that he visited his home inperson. Finding Mrs. Chadick there, he interrogated her as to thewhereabouts of her husband. She told him that Colonel Chadick was notat home. He seemed incredulous, and cross-questioned her closely, whensomething in her tone or her favor led him to change the conversation,and he said to her: 201CMadam, where are you from?201D She answered, 201CI amfrom Steubenville, Ohio.201D 201CI am also from Steubenville, Ohio. What wasyour maiden name?201D She answered, 201CMy maiden name was Cook.201D 201CWere youMiss Jane Cook?201D said he. She answered, 201CI was.201D Then said he: 201CDo youremember, many years ago, one Sunday morning, when you were on yourway to Sunday school, that some little boys were cutting up in thestreet near the Episcopal church and a policeman was about to takethem up when you interceded in their behalf and he let them off?201D Sheanswered, 201CI do.201D 201CI was one of those boys,201D said he, 201Cand now, madam,I am ready to do anything in my power for your protection and comfort.201DGuards were placed at her gates, and not a soldier allowed to enter thepremises while General McCook2019s command remained there.[Illustration: LIEUTENANT S. B. BARRONThird Texas CavalryPhoto 1882]Colonel Chadick was well known to me, he having been pastor of theCumberland Presbyterian church in Huntsville for several years whileI lived there. He first entered the army as chaplain of the FourthAlabama Infantry, and was with that famous regiment in the first battleof Manassas. He was afterwards made major of an Alabama battalion,of which Nick Davis was lieutenant-colonel, later consolidated withColtart2019s battalion, to become the Fiftieth Alabama Infantry, when JohnG. Coltart became colonel and William D. Chadick lieutenant-colonel.At this time he had an idea of raising a new regiment of cavalry, andwished me to return and raise a company for the regiment or else take aposition on his staff, but we were now too near the end.McClatchie and myself started out next morning and went up theHuntsville road a short distance, when we came in sight of a smallparty of Federal cavalry in the act of turning back. We took a roadthat led us into the Athens road at John N. Drake2019s place, where welearned that another party had come out there, and turned back. Wethen made our way directly to Pulaski, Tenn., on towards Columbia, andfound the division on the Columbia pike hotly engaged with the enemy,who was pushing General Hood2019s retreat. Our rear-guard was commanded byGeneral Forrest, and consisted of his own cavalry, Jackson2019s cavalrydivision, and about fifteen hundred infantry, under Major-GeneralWalthal. The infantry were trans-Mississippi troops, including Ector2019sand Granberry2019s brigades. General Hood2019s main army was retreatingby different roads towards Bainbridge, where we were to cross theTennessee River. Jackson2019s division of cavalry and the infantry of therear-guard were on the main road, while General Forrest2019s cavalry wasprotecting other roads. We were uncomfortably crowded on the turnpike,but we left it at Pulaski, crossed Richland Creek on a bridge, andfired the bridge. The Federals soon came up and extinguished the fire,however, and then came pouring across the bridge, but as it was nowlate in the afternoon they did not attack any more for the day.The next morning General Forrest selected a favorable position in thehills a few miles below Pulaski, masked his batteries, and formed hisinfantry in ambush, and, when the enemy came on us, attacked them withartillery, infantry, and cavalry, and after a sharp little battle drovethem back handsomely, with some loss, capturing one piece of artilleryand taught them that in the hills it was imprudent to rush upon anenemy recklessly. For the remainder of that day we were permitted tomove quietly down the road unmolested.That night one of General Frank Armstrong2019s Mississippi cavalryregiments was left on picket, and we moved on a mile or two and campedby the roadside. Just after daylight the next morning our Mississippiregiments came clattering in, closely pursued by the enemy2019s cavalry.We hastily formed a line across the road and checked the enemy, andthen moved on to Sugar Creek and formed another ambush. There was adense fog along the creek, such as I never saw in the interior. Ourinfantry were formed along the creek bank just above the crossing, andthe cavalry in column of fours in the road forty or fifty yards backfrom the ford of the creek, and thus, in the fog, we were as completelyconcealed as if midnight darkness had prevailed. The infantry remainedperfectly quiet until the head of the enemy2019s column was in the act ofcrossing the creek, when suddenly, with a yell they plunged throughthe creek and charged them. This threw the head of their column intoconfusion, when our cavalry charged them in column at a gallop, andpressed them back two or three miles. _And this was the last fight Iwas ever in!_CHAPTER XVIIIROSS2019 REPORT OF BRIGADE2019S LAST CAMPAIGN Ross2019 Report2014Repulse a Reconnoitering Party2014Effective Fighting Strength2014Advance Guard2014The Battle at Campbellsville2014Results2014Thompson2019s Station2014Harpeth River2014Murfreesboro2014Lynville2014Pulaski2014Sugar Creek2014Losses During Campaign2014Captures2014Acknowledgments.  HEADQUARTERS ROSS2019 BRIGADE, J. C. D.  CORINTH, MISS., Jan. 12, 1865.  CAPTAIN:I have the honor to submit the following report of the part performedby my brigade in the late campaign into Middle Tennessee.First, however, and by way of introduction, it is proper to premisethat we bore a full share in the arduous duties required of the cavalryin the Georgia campaign, and were particularly active during theoperations of the army upon the enemy2019s line of communication.October 24, in compliance with orders from division commander, Iwithdrew from my position near Cave Springs, Ga., crossed the CoosaRiver at Gadsden the day following, and by rapid marches arrived infront of Decatur, Ala., on the evening of the 29th. Was here halted toobserve the movements of the enemy while the army rested at Tuscumbia.On the morning of November 8 a strong reconnoitering party, consistingof three regiments of infantry and one of cavalry, coming out fromDecatur on the Courtland road, was promptly met, and after a sharpskirmish driven back with some loss. The next day, being relieved by aportion of General Roddy2019s command, we retired down the valley to TownCreek and rested until the 18th, when we were ordered across the riverat Florence, and moving at once to the front of the army, took positionwith the other cavalry commands on Shoal Creek.November 21, all things being ready for the advance, we were orderedforward, following in the rear of Armstrong2019s Brigade. The effectivefighting strength of my command at this time was as follows: ThirdRegiment Texas Cavalry, 218; Sixth Regiment Texas Cavalry, 218; NinthRegiment Texas Cavalry, 110; Twenty-seventh Regiment Texas Cavalry,140; making a total of 686. With this small force we joined theadvance into Tennessee, strong in heart and resolved to make up inzeal and courage what was wanting in numbers. The day after crossingShoal Creek, General Armstrong, having still the advance, came upwith Federal cavalry at Lawrenceburg. The fighting was chiefly withartillery, Captain Young2019s battery being freely used, and to goodeffect. About sunset the enemy withdrew in the direction of Pulaski.Early the next morning I was ordered to take the advance and move outon the Pulaski road. About twelve miles from Lawrenceburg we came uponthe Federal pickets and drove them in. The Third Texas now dismountedand with two squadrons from the Twenty-seventh Texas moved forwardand attacked the enemy, forcing him from his successive positionsand following him up so vigorously as to compel the precipitateabandonment of his camps and all his forage. The next day, having stillthe advance, when within five miles of Pulaski, we changed directionto the left, following the route taken by the enemy in his retreat theevening before, and arriving about noon in sight of the little village,Campbellsville, I found a large force of cavalry, which proved to beHatch2019s division, drawn up to resist us. Lieutenant-Colonel Boggess wasordered promptly to dismount his regiment, the Third Texas, and moveit to the front. Young2019s battery was hurried up from the rear, placedin position and, supported by the Sixth Texas (Colonel Jack Wharton,commanding), commenced shelling the enemy2019s lines. In the meanwhilethe Ninth Texas and the Legion were drawn up in column, in the fieldto the right of the wood, to be used as circumstances might require.These dispositions completed, I watched with interest the effect of theshelling from our battery, and very soon discovered from the movementsof the enemy, an intention to withdraw, whereupon, believing thisto be the proper movement, I ordered everything forward. The NinthTexas and Legion, led by their respective commanders, Colonel Jonesand Lieutenant-Colonel Whitfield, rushed forward at a gallop, andpassing through the village, fell upon the enemy2019s moving squadronswith such irresistible force as to scatter them in every direction,pursuing and capturing numbers of prisoners, horses, equipment, smallarms, accouterments, and four (4) stands of colors. The enemy madeno effort to regain the field from which he had been driven, butwhile endeavoring to withdraw his broken and discomfited squadronswas attacked vigorously in flank by a portion of General Armstrong2019sbrigade, and his rout made complete. The last of his forces, in fullflight, disappeared in the direction of Lynville about sunset, andwe saw no more of them south of Duck River. Our loss in the fight atCampbellsville was only five (5) men wounded, while our captures (Ifound upon investigation) summed up to be eighty-four (84) prisoners,and all their horses, equipments, and small arms, four (4) stands ofcolors and sixty-five (65) beef cattle. Without further oppositionwe arrived the next day in front of Columbia, and took the positionassigned us on the Chapel Hill pike.November 26, we remained in front of the enemy2019s works, skirmishingfreely and keeping up a lively demonstration. On the morning ofthe 27th, being relieved by the infantry, we were ordered over toShelbyville pike, and camped the following night on Fountain Creek.Crossing Duck River the next morning, at the mill, nine miles aboveColumbia, we were directed thence to the right (on the Shelbyvilleroad), and when near the Lewisburg and Franklin pike, again encounteredthe Federal cavalry. A spirited engagement ensued, begun by the ThirdTexas, which being detached to attack a train of wagons moving in thedirection of Franklin, succeeded in reaching the pike, but was theremet by a superior force of Yankees and driven back. Seeing this, I hadColonel Hawkins to hurry his regiment (the Legion) to the assistanceof the Third, and ordered a charge, which was made in gallant style,and resulted in forcing the Yankees from the field in confusion,and with the loss of several prisoners and the colors of the SeventhOhio Cavalry. In the meanwhile Colonel Wharton, with the Sixth Texas,charged into the pike to the right of where the Third and Legion wereengaged, capturing an entire company of the Seventh Ohio Cavalry, three(3) stands of colors, several wagons loaded with ordnances, and aconsiderable number of horses, with their equipments. The Ninth Texas(Colonel Jones), having been detached early in the evening to guardthe road leading to our right, with the exception of a slight skirmishwith the enemy2019s pickets, in which several prisoners were taken, wasnot otherwise engaged during the evening. It was now after night andvery dark. The enemy had disappeared from our front in direction ofFranklin, but before establishing camps it was thought prudent toascertain if any force had been cut off and yet remained between us andthe river. Colonel Hawkins was therefore ordered up the pike with hisregiment to reconnoiter, and had proceeded but a short distance beforehe was met by a brigade of Federal cavalry. An exciting fight ensued,lasting about half an hour, when the enemy, having much the largerforce, succeeded in passing by us, receiving as he did so a severe fireinto his flanks. This ceased the operations for the day, and we wereallowed to bivouac, well pleased with the prospect of rest, after somuch fatiguing exercise.At Hunts cross roads the next day, when the other commands of cavalrytook the left and moved upon Spring Hill, my brigade was advancedupon the road to Franklin. Afterwards, in obedience to orders of thedivision commander, we turned towards Thompson2019s Station, being now inrear of the Federal army, which still held its position on Rutherford2019sCreek. The Yankee cavalry, completely whipped, had disappeared in thedirection of Franklin, and did not again show itself that day. Whennear Thompson2019s Station I discovered a few wagons moving on the pike,and sent Colonel Jones, with the Ninth and Legion, to intercept andcapture them. At the same time the Sixth and Third Texas were drawnup in line, and a squadron from the latter dispatched to destroy thedepot. Colonel Jones was partially successful, capturing and destroyingone wagon and securing the team. He then charged a train of cars whichcame up from the direction of Franklin, when the engineer becomingfrightened, cut the engine loose and ran off southward. The train, thusfreed, began to retrograde, and in spite of the obstructions thrown inits way and the efforts of the men to stop it, rolled back under theguns of a blockhouse and was saved. The guard, however, and all themen on the train were forced to jump off, and became our prisoners.I now had the railroad bridge destroyed, in consequence of which theengine that escaped from us, and another, became the prizes of ourarmy the next day. In the meantime the enemy at the depot, observingthe approach of the squadron from the Third Texas, set fire to all ofhis valuables, including a train of cars loaded with ordnance, andevacuated the place. Having accomplished all that could be effected inthe station, we withdrew late in the evening, dropping back to the leftof Spring Hill and halted until I could communicate with the divisioncommander. About midnight I received the order directing me to again201CStrike the pike201D and attack the enemy2019s train, then in full retreatto Franklin; moved out at once to obey the order, guided by an officerof General Forrest2019s staff who knew the country. When within half amile of the pike I dismounted three (3) of my regiments, leaving theNinth Texas mounted to guard their horses, and cautiously advancingon foot, got within one hundred yards of the enemy2019s train withoutbeing discovered. The Legion (Colonel Hawkins commanding) having theadvance, fronted into line, fired a well-directed volley, killingseveral Yankees and mules, and rushed forward with a yell, producingamong the teamsters and wagon guards a perfect stampede. The Yankeeslost thirty-nine (39) wagons, some of which were destroyed, and othersabandoned for the want of the teams, which we brought off. Remaining inpossession of the pike for half an hour, we withdrew upon the approachof several bodies of infantry, which coming up in opposite directions,by mistake got to shooting into each other, and fired several volleysbefore finding out their error. Having remounted our horses, weremained on the hill overlooking the pike until daylight, and saw theYankee army in full retreat. While this was passing a regiment ofcavalry appearing in the open field in our front was charged by theSixth Texas, completely routed and driven to his infantry column. Soonafter this we again pushed forward, keeping parallel with the pike,upon which our infantry was moving, crossed Harpeth River in theevening, about three miles above Franklin, only a small force of theenemy appearing to dispute the passage. Half a mile from the river wecame upon a regiment of Yankee cavalry drawn up in line. This the NinthTexas at once charged and routed, but was met by a larger force, and inturn compelled to give back, the enemy following in close pursuit. TheThird Texas now rushed forward, checked the advancing squadrons of theYankees, and then hurled them back, broken and disorganized, capturingseveral prisoners and driving the others back upon their heavier lines.The gallant bearing of the men and officers of the Third and NinthTexas on this occasion is deserving of special commendation, and itaffords me much gratification to record to the honor of these nobleregiments that charges made by them at Harpeth River have never been,and cannot be, surpassed by cavalry of any nation. By the charge of theThird Texas we gained possession of an eminence overlooking the enemy2019sposition and held it until late in the evening, when discovering anintention on the part of the Yankee commander to advance his entireforce, and being without any support, I withdrew to the south sideof the river again. Very soon the enemy advanced his whole line, butfinding we had recrossed the river again, retreated, and during thenight withdrew from our front. The next day we moved forward, arrivedin front of Nashville December 3, and took position on the Nolensvillepike three miles from the city. Just in our front was a line of works,and wishing to ascertain what force occupied them, I had two squadronsof the Sixth Texas to dismount, deploy as skirmishers, and advance.We found the works held only by the enemy2019s skirmishers, who withdrewupon our approach. After this, being relieved by our infantry, wereturned to the rear with orders to cook up rations. On the morningof December 5 the brigade was ordered to Lavergne; found there asmall force of infantry, which took refuge inside the fort, and afterslight resistance surrendered upon demand of the division commander.Moving thence to Murfreesboro, where within a few miles of the citythe enemy2019s pickets were encountered, and after a stubborn resistancedriven back by the Sixth and Third Texas, dismounted. A few days afterthis Major-General Forrest invested Murfreesboro with his cavalry andone (1) division of infantry. The duty assigned my brigade being toguard all the approaches to the city, from the Salem to the Woodburypike inclusive, was very severe for so small a force, and almost everyday there was heavy skirmishing on some portion of our line.December 15, a train of cars from Stevenson, heavily laden withsupplies for the garrison at Murfreesboro, was attacked about sevenmiles south of the city, and although guarded by a regiment ofinfantry, two hundred strong, was captured and burned. The train wasloaded with sugar, coffee, hard bread, and bacon, and carried fulltwo hundred thousand rations. The men guarding it fought desperatelyfor about an hour, having a strong position in a cut of the railroad,but were finally routed by a most gallant charge of the Sixth Texas,supported by the Third Texas, and 150 of them captured. The othersescaped to blockhouses near by. The next day, in consequence of thereverses to our arms at Nashville, we were withdrawn from the frontof Murfreesboro, ordered across to Triana, and thence to Columbia,crossing Duck River in the evening of the 18th.December 24, while being in the rear of our army, the enemy charged myrear-guard at Lynville, with a heavy force, and threatened to breakover all opposition, when the Sixth Texas hastily forming, met andhurled them back, administering a most wholesome check to their ardor.At the moment this occurred our columns were all in motion, and itwas of the utmost importance to break the charge of the enemy on ourrear. Too much credit, therefore, cannot be given the Sixth Texas, forgallant bearing on this occasion. Had it failed to check the enemy,my brigade, and probably the entire division, taken at disadvantage,might have suffered severely. At Richland Creek, when the cavalry tookposition later in the day, I was assigned a position on the right ofthe railroad, and in front of the creek. Soon afterwards, however,the enemy moving as if to cross above the bridge, I was withdrawn tothe south side of the creek and took position on the hill near therailroad, skirmishing with the enemy in my front, holding him in checkuntil our forces had all crossed the creek. We were then ordered towithdraw, and passing through Pulaski, again crossed Richland Creekand camped near Mr. Carter2019s for the night. The next day my brigade,alternating with General Armstrong in bringing up the rear, hadfrequent skirmishes with the enemy2019s advance. Nine miles from Pulaski,when the infantry halted and formed, I was ordered on the right. Soonafter this the enemy made a strong effort to turn our right flank, butfailed, and was driven back. About the same time the infantry chargedand captured his artillery, administering such an effectual check thathe did not again show himself that day.This done, we retired leisurely, and after night bivouacked on SugarCreek. Early the following morning the Yankees, still not satisfied,made their appearance, and our infantry again made dispositions toreceive them. Reynolds2019 and Ector2019s brigades took position, andimmediately in their rear I had the Legion and Ninth Texas drawn up incolumn of fours to charge, if an opportunity should occur. The fog wasvery dense and the enemy therefore approached very cautiously. Whennear enough to be seen, the infantry fired a volley and charged. At thesame time the Legion and Ninth Texas were ordered forward, and passingthrough our infantry, crossed the creek in the face of a terriblefire, overthrew all opposition on the further side, and pursued thethoroughly routed foe near a mile, capturing twelve (12) prisoners andas many horses, besides killing numbers of others. The force opposedto us here was completely whipped,2014proved from the statements of theprisoners to be Hammond2019s brigade of cavalry. After this the Yankeesdid not again show themselves, and without further interruption werecrossed the Tennessee River at Bainbridge on the evening of the 27thof December. Our entire loss during the campaign sums up as follows:  2550255025502550255025502550255025502550255025502550255025502550255025502550256425502550255025502550255025502550255025502550255025642550255025502550255025502550255025502550255025502564255025502550255025502550255025502550255025502550256425502550255025502550255025502550255025502550                     2502   KILLED   2502   WOUNDED  2502  CAPTURED  2502      COMMAND        251C25002500250025002500250025002500252C250025002500253C25002500250025002500250025002500252C250025002500253C25002500250025002500250025002500252C2500250025002524 AGGREGATE                     2502OFFICERS2502EN.2502OFFICERS2502EN.2502OFFICERS2502EN.2502                     2502        2502MEN2502        2502MEN2502        2502MEN2502  2500250025002500250025002500250025002500250025002500250025002500250025002500253C25002500250025002500250025002500253C250025002500253C25002500250025002500250025002500253C250025002500253C25002500250025002500250025002500253C250025002500253C25002500250025002500250025002500250025002500  Third Texas Cavalry2502        2502  22502    3   2502 222502    1   2502  22502   30  Sixth Texas Cavalry2502        2502  62502    3   2502 192502        2502  12502   29  Ninth Texas Cavalry2502        2502  42502        2502 172502        2502  12502   22  Texas Texas Legion 2502        2502   2502        2502  62502        2502   2502    6  2500250025002500250025002500250025002500250025002500250025002500250025002500253C25002500250025002500250025002500253C250025002500253C25002500250025002500250025002500253C250025002500253C25002500250025002500250025002500253C250025002500253C25002500250025002500250025002500250025002500      Total          2502        2502 122502    6   2502 642502    1   2502  42502   87  2500250025002500250025002500250025002500250025002500250025002500250025002500253425002500250025002500250025002500253425002500250025342500250025002500250025002500250025342500250025002534250025002500250025002500250025002534250025002500253425002500250025002500250025002500250025002500We captured on the trip and brought off five hundred and fifty (550)prisoners, as shown by the records of my provost-marshal, nine (9)stands of colors, several hundred horses and their equipments, andovercoats and blankets sufficient to supply my command. We destroyed,besides, two trains of cars, loaded, one with ordnance, and the otherwith commissary stores; forty or fifty wagons and mules; and muchother valuable property belonging to the Federal army. My brigadereturned from Tennessee with horses very much jaded, but otherwise inno worse condition than when it started, its morale not in the leastaffected nor impaired by the evident demoralization which prevailed toa considerable extent throughout the larger portion of the army.Before closing my report I desire to record an acknowledgment ofgrateful obligations to the gallant officers and brave men whom I havethe honor to command. Entering upon the campaign poorly clad and illyprepared for undergoing its hardships, these worthy votaries of freedomnevertheless bore themselves bravely, and I did not hear a murmur,nor witness the least reluctance in the discharge of duty, howeverunpleasant. All did well, and to this I attribute in a great measurethe unparalleled success which attended all our efforts during thecampaign.To Colonel D. W. Jones, Colonel E. R. Hawkins, Colonel Jack Wharton,Lieutenant-Colonel J. S. Boggess, who commanded their respectiveregiments; and Lieutenant-Colonel P. F. Ross and Major S. B. Wilson,Sixth Texas; Lieutenant-Colonel J. T.

The weather was quite cold andmany of our poor soldiers had to march over frozen ground barefooted.Between the 25th day of December, 1864, and the 1st day of January,1865, everything had crossed to the south side of the river, duringa little more than a month having seen much hard service, severefighting, and demoralizing disaster. We continued to move leisurelysouthward. The main army moved to Tupelo, Miss., while our commandmoved to Egypt Station on the Mobile & Ohio Railroad. After crossingthe river General Ross detailed Captain H. W. Wade, of the Sixth Texas,Lieutenant Thompson Morris, of the Legion, and myself as a permanentbrigade court-martial.Egypt Station is situated in one of the richest of the black landdistricts. Corn was abundant, and we remained there several days,during which time it rained almost incessantly, but the court-martialprocured quarters in a house and was able to keep out of the blackmud, which was very trying on the men in camp. Being scarce oftransportation for baggage when we started to Georgia, the officers2019trunks and valises, containing all their best clothes, were left inMississippi in charge of a detail of two men, afterwards reduced toone. While we were moving out of Tennessee the baggage was run up to asmall station on the Mobile & Ohio Railroad, and just before we reachedit a small scouting party of the enemy2019s cavalry swooped down, firedthe station, and all our good clothes went up in smoke. In fact, thisand Kilpatrick2019s raid left me with almost 201Cnothing to wear.201DLeaving Egypt, we moved slowly back to our old stamping-ground in theYazoo country. We camped one night some seventy-five miles north ofKosciusko, and in the morning, before the command was ready to move,about 180 men from the brigade, including several from Company C, ThirdTexas, mounted their horses and moved out, without leave, and startedfor the west side of the Mississippi River. They had organized whatthey were pleased to call an 201Cowl train,201D a term of no significanceworth explaining. It meant that they had become demoralized andimpatient for the promised furlough, and had determined to go homewithout leave. It was a source of great regret to see numbers of menwho had been good soldiers for fully three and a half years thusdefiantly quit the command with which they had so faithfully served,but not a harsh word was said to them, nor was effort made to stopthem. Whether they would have returned or not, I do not know; perhapsmany of them would, but circumstances were such that they never did. Tothis day many of them, perhaps all, live in constant regret that theywere induced to take this one false step when we were so near the end.On the same morning Lieutenant William H. Carr and myself obtainedpermission to go ahead of the command, to have some boots made, andstarted for Mr. Richburg2019s shop. A little after night the second daywe reached the house of Mr. Savage, and obtained permission to spendthe night. Soon after we were seated by a splendid blazing fire, hisdaughter, Miss Hattie, whom I had met at Mr. Blunt2019s about eighteenmonths before, came into the room. She recognized me very readily, andwas apparently glad to meet me again. As there was to be a weddingat their house in about three days, she very cordially invited us toattend, which we agreed to do, provided we remained in the neighborhoodthat long. We hurried on to Richburg2019s shop, ordered our boots, whichhe promised to make right away2014that is, in about three days. We thenwent to the home of my friends, the Ayres family, and made that ourhome for the time being. The wedding was attended by us, in companywith Miss Andrews, the step-daughter, and our boots were finished justin time to enable us to join the wedding party at the dinner giventhe next day in Kosciusko, ten miles on our way. Here we dined, afterwhich, bidding farewell to our friends and acquaintances, we hastenedon to overtake our command.Unexpectedly, a little later, we were favored with an order to furloughone-half of the command, officers and men, it being my fortune to beof the 201Cone-half.201D Selecting and sending up the names of those tobe furloughed, writing up and returning the papers, consumed time,so that it was February before we were ready to start to Texas.Lieutenant-Colonel Jiles S. Boggess, of the Third Texas, being theranking field officer to go, was to be nominally in charge of thefurloughed men, and as he lived in Henderson, my expectation was togo home with him; but it turned out otherwise. The day for startingwas agreed on, leaving Colonel Boggess to bring my papers and meetme at Murdock2019s ferry on Yazoo River. I left camp the day before andwent up to the home of John F. Williams and spent the night. JohnF. Williams had been sheriff of Cherokee County, Texas, in an earlyday, but had moved back to Mississippi. His two sons had joined ourcompany, but Wyatt, the older one, being physically disqualified, hadbeen discharged. He was anxious to come to his grandfather in Marshall,Texas, and I loaned him a horse on which to make the trip; and,declining to bring my boy Jake on so long a ride, to return so soon (asI then believed), I gave him a horse and saddle and told him to takecare of himself.Starting next morning with Wyatt Williams, I came on to Lexington andspent the night at the residence of our 201CAunt Emma Hays.201D Mrs. Hayswas one of the noblest women we met in Mississippi, a great friend toRoss2019s brigade collectively, and a special friend to a good many of usindividually. Her good old mother, Mrs. West, was there. She had livedin Marion, Ala., and was strongly attached to persons of my name there,and would always insist that I favored them, and was related to them;and the good, kind-hearted creature would do all she could for me andseemed to regret that she could not do more. These two kindly ladiesfurnished me luncheon enough to have lasted me, individually, almost toRusk.The next day we rode in the rain all day to Murdock2019s ferry, where, aswe arrived after dark, it required a good deal of yelling and waitingto get a boat to cross in. Finally we stopped at Colonel Murdock2019sgate and, although his house appeared to be full of soldiers, we werewelcome. Murdock was the big-hearted man who, when the brigade campedon his premises for a day and night, refused to sell the man sweetpotatoes, but said: 201CGo back and tell the boys to come up to the houseand get as many as they want.201D I had made the acquaintance of Mrs.Murdock and her sister, Miss Ford, of Louisiana, who was visiting her,at Lexington some months previous. I found Captain Sid Johnson, ofTyler, was at Mrs. Murdock2019s home. Mrs. Murdock whispered to me andsaid: 201CSupper will soon be ready for the company, but I wish you andCaptain Johnson to wait and eat with the family.201D This we did, andafterwards were invited into the parlor, and pleasantly entertained bythe ladies, Mrs. Murdock the while urging me to remain and spend myleave of absence with them instead of going to Texas.In the meantime the rain continued to pour down, and increased inviolence, continuing all next day and the next night. While the othersall pushed on except Williams and myself, I remained there untilafternoon. About noon Colonel Boggess reined up at the gate long enoughto say 201CCome ahead,201D and rode off in a torrent of rain, and the nexttime I saw him he was in Henderson, his home. Finally Williams and Istarted, intending to cross Sunflower Swamp and Sunflower River thatevening, but soon found the whole country was overflowed, and losingmuch valuable time in trying to cross a creek without swimming it wehad to lay out in the swamp that night. We cut a lot of cane for ourhorses to stand on, and piled a lot up by an old tree, and on that wesat down all night in the rain.Next morning by swimming a large creek we reached Sunflower River,found it bank full, the ferryboat on the west side, and the ferrymangone. By going down the river three or four miles we found a farm anda private ferry, but it was afternoon when we crossed. Reaching theMississippi we found a number of the men waiting to get over, butColonel Boggess had crossed and gone on. The crossing was tedious inthe extreme, as the only means of doing so was to swim the horses bythe side of a skiff, and this had to be done in the daytime, when youhad to look out for gunboats. When over, it was very uncertain withwhom you were going to travel, as every fellow, when he got his horseup the bank and over the levee on the west side, at once struck out forTexas. I lost Williams and never saw him afterwards.The country between the Mississippi and Red River was practicallyafloat. We crossed a great many streams, how many I do not remember,and we found but one stream, Little River, where the bridge was notwashed away. We traveled along near the Arkansas and Louisiana line,sometimes in one State and sometimes in the other. The first streamencountered after crossing the Mississippi was a large bayou in thebottom, which we crossed on a raft constructed of logs tied together.We ferried Ouachita River, two miles, crossed Little River on a bridge,and had to swim every other stream, averaging something like three aday. We struck Red River at Carolina Bluff, some twenty miles aboveShreveport, and had to swim the overflow in several places to get downto Shreveport, where we found dry ground. We came through it all withbut one serious accident, and that was the drowning of a negro boy. Itraveled mostly with Dr. Blocker, of Harrison County, and three or fourof the Third Texas from Smith County.One morning I found my horse badly foundered, so that I could not keepup with my crowd. Coming to Magnolia, Ark., about noon, I had to sellone of my pistols in order to trade for a horse that was able to bringme on.Upon reaching Henderson, about eleven o2019clock one day, the first man Irecognized on the street was Lieutenant-Colonel Jiles S. Boggess, ofthe Third Texas Cavalry. He abused me roundly for being behind, andthreatened that I should never leave the town with whole bones unlessI went down to his house and took a rest and dinner with him, and Iyielded. Here I learned that the 201Cowl train201D gang had not yet reachedTexas, that they crossed the river, had been arrested at Alexandria,perhaps, and were detained under guard at Shreveport. Through theinfluence of Colonel Boggess, however, they were soon afterwardsreleased by General Smith and allowed to come home.I reached Rusk a little before noon the next day.The following is a true copy of the paper on which I came to Texas:  HD. QTS. ROSS BRIG. CAV.,  Deasonville, Miss., Feb. 20, 1865.  Special orders  No. 2.  Ext. By authority from Lieutenant-General Taylor Leaves of absence are granted to the following named officers for Sixty (60) days.       *       *       *       *       * XXVII Lieutenant S. B. Barron, Company 201CC201D Third Texas.  L. S. ROSS,  _Brig. Gen2019l._At the proper time I presented myself to Colonel Boggess at Henderson,and reported to him that I was ready to start back. He told me he hadno idea that we could cross the river, as it was reported to be fromfive to twenty-five miles wide; that he had sent a man to ascertainwhether it was possible for us to cross it, and if so he would letme know, and directed me to return to Rusk and remain until I heardfrom him. Thus matters stood until the startling news reached usthat General R. E. Lee had surrendered his army in Virginia. Thiswas followed in quick succession by the surrender of General JosephE. Johnston in North Carolina, the other commanding officer, andfinally by General E. Kirby Smith2019s surrender of the trans-Mississippidepartment.And then2014then the four years2019 war, with all its fun and frolic, allits hardships and privations, its advances and retreats, its victoriesand defeats, its killing and maiming, was at an end.I am unable to give the losses of Ross2019 brigade sustained in theAtlanta campaign. If it was ever given out officially I never sawit. But our ranks were very much depleted as the result of thislong campaign. Some went to the hospitals badly wounded, some werefurloughed with wounds not considered dangerous, some were rolled intheir blankets and buried where they fell, and others were carried toNorthern prisons, there to die or remain until the close of the war.Nor can I now give the loss we sustained in the Nashville campaign. Itwas carefully made up in detail, but I do not remember it. I rememberthat John B. Long, of Company C, was shot through both thighs, andI remember two gallant members of Company B, Bud McClure and JoeRobinson, were killed near Pulaski on the retreat.       *       *       *       *       *The regulation that our horses should be listed and valued now andthen, to show the estimation placed upon horseflesh in the currency ofour Government, I give the following valuations made in the early partof the year 1864, of the officers and men then present for duty, viz.:Captain John Germany, one bay horse, $2000; Lieutenant W.

BALDWIN, June 4, 1862.General Order No. 62:The General commanding takes great pleasure in calling the attentionof the army to the brave, skillful and gallant conduct of Lieut. Col.Lane, of the Third Regt. Texas Dismounted Cavalry, who with two hundredand forty-six men, on the 29th ult., charged a largely superior forceof the enemy, drove him from his position, and forced him to leave anumber of his dead and wounded on the field. The conduct of this braveregiment is worthy of all honor and imitation. In this affair, PrivateJ. N. Smith was particularly distinguished for brave and gallantconduct in the discharge of his duty, and was severely wounded. To him,on some future occasion, will be awarded a suitable 201CBadge of Honor.201DBy command of Gen2019l Beauregard.(Signed): GEORGE W. BRENT, Acting Chief of Staff.Private J. N.
